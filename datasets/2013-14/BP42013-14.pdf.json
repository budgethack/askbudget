The Government continues to deliver a substantial infrastructure program which will enhance the State's productive capacity and provide the platform for improved services to the community. The Government's ability to sustainably fund new investment in critical infrastructure is made possible by its strong ongoing commitment to responsible economic and financial management. Strong financial management will enable the Government to maintain general government sector infrastructure investment at 1.3 per cent of gross state product (GSP) (rolling five-year average) over the budget and forward estimates. It also means that the Government has the capacity to deliver critical infrastructure to improve productivity and support delivery of key services across the State, as well as progressing and delivering major city and state-shaping transformational projects. The Government's 2013-14 capital program includes a range of important investments to maintain the service capacity of Victoria's infrastructure and meet growing demand. Investments address a wide range of service needs, including new and improved health and education facilities, investment in local roads and public transport and continued investment in infrastructure to support public safety and emergency services. The 2013-14 Budget provides significant funding for projects that will shape the state and city, such as delivering East West Link - Stage 1 and the redevelopment of the Port of Hastings. The total value of Victorian public sector capital projects underway or commencing in 2013-14, including projects across both the general government and public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sectors, is well in excess of $48 billion. This includes projects being delivered through public private partnerships (PPPs) and indicative values for the East West Link - Stage 1 and Webb Dock development projects."

Further funding has also been committed to progress detailed planning for Melbourne Metro rail tunnel and the redevelopment of the Port of Hastings. For the effective and timely delivery of infrastructure to meet community needs, infrastructure planning must work hand in hand with urban and regional planning. Integrated land use and infrastructure planning requires successfully combining modern public transport and key local infrastructure to deliver better local environments for Victorian communities. To this end, the Government has integrated planning, urban design and local infrastructure with service delivery in a new Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure."

High-value and high-risk asset investments are defined as those that: \u2022 have a total estimated investment (TEI) greater than $100 million, regardless of the funding source; \u2022 are identified as high risk, using an approved risk assessment tool; or \u2022 are determined by the Government as warranting the rigour of increased oversight. Proposals assessed as high-value and/or high-risk are subject to more stringent processes at all stages of development, including increased central oversight and the Treasurer's approval at key stages in their project lifecycle. Gateway reviews (peer reviews designed to improve investment selection, management and delivery) are required. This increased scrutiny and support for high-value and high-risk investments aims to systematically improve on-time and on-budget delivery of projects. The high-value and high-risk projects subjected to increased oversight include the projects listed in Tables 1 and 2."

Partnerships Victoria provides a framework for a whole of government approach to the provision of infrastructure and related services through PPPs. It focuses on whole of life costing, full consideration of project risks and optimal risk allocation between the public and private sectors. This is part of the overall framework for high-value and high-risk projects. Recent reforms to Victoria's PPP policies will ensure Victoria has the right model for engaging the private sector to drive innovation and efficiency. The policy changes respond to industry and practitioner feedback received through a public consultation process. PPP reforms adopt modified financing structures to improve value for money outcomes. The reforms also include expanding the scope of services provided by the private sector and streamlining tender processes. Value for money continues to be tested via a robust Public Sector Comparator benchmark. The assumed alternative procurement option will be removed and where appropriate the comparator will be an affordability benchmark with a scope ladder. Together with action to reduce bid costs and build government capability, the reforms will improve infrastructure and services delivered through the PPP framework. The choice between public and private sector provision of infrastructure and associated services is assessed on value for money and public interest considerations. This framework ensures that procurement decisions are based on merit and outcomes are judged on the public benefits obtained. The majority of PPP projects are government funded through availability payments, financed by the private sector and recognised as a finance lease in the government's accounts. There are currently 25 PPP projects. Of these, 20 have been commissioned and are now operational and two are under construction. There are three new projects including the new Bendigo Hospital which is being tendered and the new male prison at Ravenhall which will be released to market as a PPP project during 2013. The third, the East West Link - Stage 1 project will also be delivered as a PPP and is expected to go to market by late 2013."

Chapter 2 provides a detailed list of discrete projects funded through the annual state budget process for each major agency in the general government sector.

This includes expenditure relating to agency's ongoing capital programs (such as minor works, refurbishments and vehicle fleet purchases) and capital expenditure of outer budget entities (such as schools and hospitals) funded through their own revenue sources, such as donations. Chapter 2 identifies for each agency the aggregate value of the capital expenditure not attributable to discrete projects listed in Budget Paper No. 4. The individually listed new and existing capital projects listed in Chapter 2 and summarised in Table 5 predominantly comprise projects funded by government through the annual State budget process where the resulting asset or infrastructure is owned and managed by a general government sector agency. This includes investments in schools, roads, hospitals, courts and police stations. The Government also provides significant funding for infrastructure (including major public transport infrastructure) where the resulting assets ultimately reside in the balance sheet of the PNFC sector. These projects, although funded through the annual budget process, are listed in Chapter 3 against the relevant PNFC entity.

For significant investments, PNFC entities are required to submit a detailed business case for the Treasurer's approval. These business cases are reviewed and evaluated by the Department of Treasury and Finance. The threshold above which business cases are required is set for each entity according to a three-tiered approach, being $10 million, $20 million or $50 million, depending on the relative size and risk of the PNFC entity. The three thresholds have been developed to ensure that the business case review and approval process focuses on those projects that are complex, high-value and/or high-risk. Table 8 summarises the value of the 2013-14 capital projects by PNFC entity. Projects with a TEI equal to or greater than $1 million are listed individually in this publication . The estimated expenditure on other capital is also detailed in each entity's table of projects. Minor changes in TEI may occur from year to year, subject to the approval of the board of the entity. Information for ongoing projects, such as upgrade or maintenance works, is provided by agencies based upon the budget estimates period, using planning data where appropriate."

(d) This project was previously included in the Rural Overtaking Lanes initiative. (e) TEI reduction relates to lower than anticipated tender prices.
