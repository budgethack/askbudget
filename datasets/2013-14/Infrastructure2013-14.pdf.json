The Coalition Government has developed and delivered a record infrastructure program. Since coming to office in late 2010, the Coalition Government has, and is, investing each year an average of around $5 billion on infrastructure, compared with an average of around $3 billion per year during the previous decade. In 2013\u201114, general government sector investment in roads, public transport, health, schools and other infrastructure is expected to total $6.1 billion - a new infrastructure investment record for Victoria. This investment builds on the $5.6 billion estimated infrastructure spend in 2012\u201113. The total value of Victorian public sector capital projects underway or commencing in 2013\u201114, including projects across both the general government and public non\u2011financial corporations (PNFC) sectors, is in excess of $48 billion. This includes projects being delivered through public private partnerships (PPPs) and indicative values for the East West Link - Stage 1 and the Webb Dock redevelopment projects. In 2013\u201114, the Coalition Government is also delivering on its election commitments by investing over $3.3 billion in capital projects.

                    "text": "Infrastructure provides the platform for delivering high quality services to the community. It has a significant impact on state and national productivity and has the ability to generate significant employment. Economic infrastructure is central to driving growth and building on the State's strong reputation as a great place to live, invest and grow a business. Victoria's key economic opportunities come from emerging international markets, an expanding CBD, thriving regional cities and a productive agricultural sector. These are creating a diverse and dynamic economy, changing the location and distribution of business\u2011to\u2011business activity and producing a rapidly growing freight task. The Coalition Government understands the current challenges affecting communities and businesses in Victoria, and that an increasing and expanding population is changing the way we live, move and do business in the State. To address these challenges, the Government's infrastructure agenda focuses on delivering essential projects to fix and grow Victoria's infrastructure today, and also plan to address the State's future infrastructure needs. Fix: addressing immediate system needs Since coming to office, the Coalition Government has invested in projects that fix Victoria's existing infrastructure. These initiatives include significant improvements to the road network, upgrades to police and fire stations across the State, redeveloped and upgraded hospital infrastructure (such as the redevelopment of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital) and modernised schools. The Coalition Government is taking action to systematically eliminate a number of level crossings across Victoria. The Government has fully funded the full removal of five level crossings across Melbourne which are expected to be completed in the Government's first term. In addition, work is underway through the Metro Level Crossing Blitz program towards eliminating a further seven level crossings. Grow: investing in infrastructure to support a growing, moving population The Government is providing the infrastructure to support population growth and improve liveability and productivity. Projects that support growth include investing in new trams and additional metropolitan and regional train rolling stock, the new Monash Children's Hospital and the new Waurn Ponds Community Hospital. The Government is also investing in projects that will transform the way we move, live, work and do business around the State. These projects include: > the $630 million new Bendigo Hospital; > addressing gaps in the Regional Rail Link project (including funding additional regional rolling stock); and > the M80 road upgrade. Building on these achievements, the Government will start work on the $6 to $8 billion East West Link - Stage 1 project. It has also committed $110 million to progress the development of the Port of Hastings. These projects will increase Victoria's capacity for trade and create better linkages across the State. Plan: infrastructure planning for the future The Government is getting on with the job of delivering infrastructure today. But we need to keep thinking and planning for the future. Undertaking proper project planning and development work today on key projects will ensure that the Coalition Government is in a position to deliver the infrastructure Victoria needs in the future as demand rises and funding becomes available. The Government's commitment to effective infrastructure planning is demonstrated by the range of work being progressed, including for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel and the proposed expansion of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. Recognising the interdependency of transport, infrastructure and land\u2011use planning, the Government has established the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure. The new department will ensure seamless integration of transport, infrastructure and land use planning across the State to support smart, sustainable growth. Infrastructure to support the world's most liveable city and state Appropriate, responsible, smart investment in infrastructure is a key component of a resilient and liveable state. The Economic Intelligence Unit rated Melbourne the world's most liveable city in 2012. Melbourne is the only Australian city with a ranking in the new global city prosperity index compiled by the United Nations Habitat agency. The State of the World's Cities 2012/13: Prosperity of Cities report examined 95 cities. Melbourne was ranked sixth in the world in the index, which measures not only productivity and infrastructure development, but quality of life, equity and social inclusion and environmental sustainability. These measures demonstrate that growth and liveability can exist together."

                    "text": "The East West Link will transform the way people move around Melbourne in a way not seen since the construction of CityLink. In the 2013-14 Budget the Government has provided funding to commence procurement and delivery of the East West Link - Stage 1. This project will provide an approximately six kilometre freeway\u2011standard link between the Eastern Freeway at Hoddle Street and CityLink at Parkville. The project is the first stage of the Government's longer\u2011term commitment to the East West Link as a whole, a planned 18 kilometre road link, which will connect the Eastern Freeway at Hoddle Street with the Western Ring Road in Sunshine West. The 2013-14 Budget provides funding capacity to deliver East West Link - Stage 1, which has an estimated capital cost of between $6 and $8 billion. The majority of the project is proposed to be a tunnel to minimise any social, visual, noise and environmental impacts. The statutory planning process for Stage 1 is already underway and the project is expected to go to market for procurement by late 2013. Construction is expected to commence in late 2014, and a construction period of 5 years is anticipated. As a nation\u2011building piece of major infrastructure, a funding contribution of $1.5 billion from the Commonwealth Government will be required to ensure the timely delivery on this transformational infrastructure project. The project is expected to be delivered as a public private partnership, with financing sourced from Victorian Government, Commonwealth Government and private sector contributions. Toll revenue is expected to partly defray the costs of the project over the longer term. The Government is also investigating opportunities for some early works and complementary projects which could commence earlier than this to provide additional benefits. Improving the way we move around Melbourne > Travelling between the Eastern Freeway and CityLink could take as little as 7 minutes, and save on average around 15 to 20 minutes for trips across the north of the CBD in comparison with current journeys. > Commuters will bypass 16 sets of traffic lights. Without a major improvement in connectivity between the major metropolitan freeways, there will be more congestion on the city's roads. It will be harder for people to get to work, for businesses to access suppliers and customers, and for freight to move more efficiently to markets. Congestion is an immediate issue for all Victorians. Even with strong increases in public transport investment, Melbourne faces the daunting task of managing at least an additional 3 million car trips per day by 2031. Minor incidents on the Monash Freeway and CityLink cause gridlock across Melbourne with cross\u2011city traffic spilling over onto roads which are at or near full capacity. The East West Link will ultimately provide additional capacity and reduce reliance on the West Gate Bridge and M1 Corridor. This cross\u2011city alternative will alleviate congestion and improve travel time reliability for families and business. The East West Link will help give business the certainty it needs to continue to invest in Victoria, promote productivity and enhance Victoria's liveability. Benefits for business The East West Link will better connect businesses in Melbourne's south east with Melbourne Airport. It will also ultimately complement the increased container capacity planned for the Port of Melbourne and will provide a bypass of Melbourne for regional freight, helping to reduce costs for regional exporters. The East West Link will also benefit local businesses by providing better access to jobs and contributing to increased productivity by improving travel times and reliability, lowering travel costs and supporting growth in the business sector. Wider benefits for the community Public transport is a major user of Victoria's roads. In Melbourne, for example, more than 80 per cent of public transport (bus and tram) kilometres are travelled on roads. The East West Link project is expected to deliver public transport benefits, with more reliable services and faster travel times for users of some of Melbourne's busiest north\u2011south tram routes to the CBD. The East West Link will allow greater priority to be given to enhanced north\u2011south tram and bus services, cycling routes and pedestrian movements by reducing the volume of through traffic on local streets and arterial roads. The areas in the inner north are among the fastest growing areas of the central city. Stage 1 of the project will support and enhance this growth by increasing liveability and amenity of the inner north, by making it easier for people to move around their area and reducing the intrusion of traffic congestion on communities. The Government's vision for the East West Link project includes improving public transport, leveraging urban renewal opportunities and supporting sustainable communities and land use development. The $6 to $8 billion estimated capital cost of Stage 1 of the project includes some provision for investment in public transport and urban amenity improvements along the corridor. Opportunities to enhance streetscapes, pedestrian networks and community facilities are just some of the amenity improvements that may flow from the East West Link. As part of the Stage 1 of the project the Government will work with the community to consider options for public transport and urban amenity improvements. 12 > 2013-14 Budget Information Paper No.2"

Through building new roads and improving existing ones, Victorians have better access to work, home as well as goods and services. These investments are also laying the foundations for urban development in both metropolitan and regional Victoria. Improving the condition and safety of our roads The Coalition Government is investing: > to deliver the $1 billion, 10 year Road Safety Strategy (2013\u201122), incorporating the existing Safer Roads Infrastructure program; > $90 million over three years to restore parts of Victoria's arterial road network; > $80 million over two years for priority maintenance works to ensure safe and efficient operation of the road network; and > $32 million for maintenance of the West Gate Bridge over four years, ensuring the longevity of this important asset. This is in addition to $32 million of Commonwealth funding, bringing the total to $64 million. Metro level crossing blitz Metro level crossings are notorious for local commuters and pedestrians who use surrounding roads, because of the traffic jams, delays, and the safety hazards they pose, particularly during peak hours. For instance, at many locations boom gates at level crossings can be closed for more than 50 minutes of the two\u2011hour peak period and by eliminating these level crossing the Coalition Government is relieving congestion delays, reducing individual road user trips times and making them safer for pedestrians. The Government has committed to the removal of 12 metropolitan level crossings. This work is substantially underway with three level crossing removals at Springvale Road, Springvale, Mitcham and Rooks Roads, Mitcham, as well as two in Sunshine as part of the Regional Rail Link project expected to be completed by the end of the Government's first term. Building on the $367 million provided over the past two years, the 2013-14 Budget commits an additional $52 million to progress planning or early works for the removal of a further seven crossings through the Metro Level Crossing Blitz program. Level crossings removal already underway > Springvale Road, Springvale; > Mitcham Road, Mitcham; > Rooks Road, Mitcham; and > two level crossings on Anderson Road, Sunshine as part of the Regional Rail Link project.

This builds on previous investments, including $156 million for the construction of the Dingley Bypass and $13 million to upgrade Stud Road between Boronia Road and Mountain Highway. Using technology to improve our freeways The Government is using the latest technology to ensure optimal operation of our freeways and reduce travel times for freeway users. Subject to a commitment of funding from the Commonwealth, the Government will provide $10 million in 2013\u201114 for the Managed Motorway Program. This program will install a range of traffic management devices along the section of the Monash Freeway between High Street, Glen Iris and Warrigal Road, Chadstone to improve traffic flow and reduce travel times for people and businesses. Victoria is a world\u2011leader in freeway management with the installation of state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art devices as part of this project, including variable speed limit signs, CCTV cameras, and supporting IT infrastructure. Improvements for rural and regional Victorian roads The Government is building a better future in regional and rural Victoria by fixing country roads and infrastructure, improving safety and access, and building new links to revitalise and grow our regions. Projects underway or completed in regional Victoria include: > the $66 million Koo Wee Rup Bypass; > $38 million for the Ballarat Western Link Road; > $16 million for overtaking lanes on the Strzelecki Highway and Hyland Highway and the Melbourne\u2011Lancefield Road; > $101 million for the duplication of the Western Highway from Ballarat to Stawell; and > $6 million to upgrade rest areas along the Hume Freeway with additional truck parking spaces and improved amenities.

The Government is transforming regional and metropolitan rail services by delivering the Regional Rail Link project with enhanced scope and oversight from Government. The $4.8 billion Regional Rail Link project is a vital piece of infrastructure for the booming western suburbs, regional Victoria, and for passengers across Melbourne's rail network. It is an important foundation for future growth in capacity and reliability of Victoria's train network. Through building dedicated regional tracks from West Werribee Junction to Southern Cross Station this landmark project will remove major bottlenecks in Victoria's rail network. When complete, passengers on the Geelong, Bendigo and Ballarat lines will have a journey, uninterrupted by metro trains, through the metropolitan system with more reliable and more frequent connections to central Melbourne to get them to and from the city for work, study, business and recreation. When the Coalition Government came to office, this project was inadequately funded, and no rolling stock had been costed into the overall project budget. The Government has taken decisive action to reconfigure the project, and bring the project back on track. The Coalition Government has also invested an additional $261 million in 40 new regional carriages and associated infrastructure, to improve the capacity and frequency of trains for passengers on country lines. Under the reconfigured scope, the Government provided funding for two additional rail grade separations at Anderson Road, Sunshine. Removal of these level crossings will ease congestion and improve safety for both road and rail passengers. Tenders have been let and work is now substantially underway."

Increasing capacity and quality The Government is committed to delivering a modern fleet of passenger rolling stock for Victoria's metropolitan and regional train and tram networks, to provide improved passenger amenity and meet the needs of growing patronage. The Government has announced its commitment of an additional $176 million for the procurement of a further eight new X'Trapolis trains to be fitted out by a local train manufacturer Alstom in Ballarat. This complements the $210 million provided in the 2011-12 Budget to purchase seven trains, four of which are now in service. Funding of $2 million is also provided to develop a high capacity train procurement strategy to underpin design and delivery of a new generation train that meets the specific requirements of Melbourne's metropolitan train network. In addition, 50 new low\u2011floor trams are currently being built to ensure trams remain an iconic part of Melbourne for years to come. The new trams are being built by a local manufacturer in Dandenong, and will boost the capacity of the tram network and provide an improved tram ride for passengers. The new trams will carry around 210 passengers, will have a low floor to provide easier access to level access tram stops, be fully air\u2011conditioned to improve passenger comfort and safety and will have state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art audio and visual announcements to update passengers on the current location and the next stop.

This budget provides $110 million for the planning, development and approvals necessary for procurement and construction of an expanded Port of Hastings by 2025. The Port of Melbourne's $1.6 billion Port Capacity Expansion Project will redevelop Webb Dock East, provide a new automotive terminal at Webb Dock West, and will facilitate an expansion of Swanson Dock, all of which will result in an increase in the container and automotive terminal capacity within the Port of Melbourne precinct. These two projects will ensure that Victoria remains at the centre of Australia's international freight sector. Transport Solutions is a $24 million suite of infrastructure upgrade projects funded in this budget. The projects main focus is on roads that fix bottlenecks affecting key agricultural industry supply chains in Regional Victoria. All of these projects are low cost projects that will be delivered within one to three years and will either increase capacity on the network or enhance the efficiency of existing infrastructure. The Transport Solutions investment will increase productivity for Victoria's key industries, particularly the State's manufacturing, agricultural and resources sectors."

This includes future transformational projects, infrastructure upgrades and expanding the capacity of the network. This budget includes $10 million in 2013\u201114 to continue planning and development of the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel, a city\u2011shaping project of a similar size and scale to Melbourne's City Loop 40 years ago. The Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel will connect the Sunbury and Dandenong rail lines by a 9 kilometre rail tunnel through the CBD, with five new stations at Arden, Parkville, CBD North, CBD South and Domain. The project will result in capacity for over 20 000 additional passengers per hour across the metropolitan rail network. The Melbourne Metro project will also provide the core network capacity to enable the expansion of Melbourne's rail network in the future, including projects such as the Rowville Rail Link, Doncaster Rail Link and Melbourne Airport Rail Link. The Victorian Government is committed to ensuring that it plans and scopes projects properly, to improve efficiency and reduce costs to Victorian taxpayers. The Government has provided funding in this budget to develop a pilot for high capacity signalling on Melbourne metropolitan rail network. High capacity signalling is a longer\u2011term project which will bring Melbourne's rail network into the 21st century, and address faults currently experienced by using the ageing signalling system. This project will increase the capacity of Melbourne's metropolitan train network. Through funding further development, the Government will identify an appropriate pilot location to test key features of High Capacity Signalling technology in the Melbourne metropolitan environment. This Government will ensure that Victoria not only has a more reliable transport system in the short term, but is also identifying transport network corridors for the medium to long term. Corridors that have already been investigated include: > Doncaster Rail Link Study - a feasibility study into the potential for a rail link to Doncaster; > Rowville Rail Link Study - a feasibility study into the potential for a rail link to Rowville; and > Melbourne Airport Rail Link - a feasibility study into a new rail link with a preferred option of a centrally located terminal at Melbourne Airport.

To achieve this bold objective, the Government is investing in school infrastructure to cater for a number of challenges. In some of Melbourne's new and growing communities, there is limited choice of government schools, with many existing schools in these communities at or near enrolment capacity. Students in growing areas often have to travel outside their local areas to ensure access to school services. These areas will require new schools to meet the forecast enrolment demand as communities expand or are created to respond to population increases. Other school communities face either excess or insufficient infrastructure levels based on these projections. From the 2011-12 Budget the Government has invested over $408 million in Victorian school infrastructure. This includes delivering on its election commitments to upgrade government schools, investing in Melbourne's growth areas and regional Victoria, providing infrastructure to support vulnerable children, and securing the future education needs of Victorians. Highlights include: > $74 million has been directed to the construction of new schools in both regional and metropolitan Melbourne, including Torquay Secondary College, Point Cook South East P\u20119, and Doreen South Primary School; > over $100 million in school regeneration; > $138 million for school modernisation programs; > more than $25 million for minor works and refurbishments for Victorian schools; > over $60 million to date has been directed to identifying and providing solutions for growing areas needing additional education providers, including acquisition of land across Victoria for the construction of new schools; and > in its first budget the Government provided the largest single year investment in special and autistic schools in over a decade, with over $41 million for the regeneration and modernisation of schools in Broadmeadows, Horsham, Wantirna Heights, Rosamond and the Northern School for Autism. This funding was also provided towards a new special school at Officer ($15 million) and the Western Autistic school ($10 million). Upgrading Schools Since coming into office, the Government has upgraded 59 schools. This includes modernisation, regeneration, planning, minor works, and refurbishments. Schools that have received upgrades include: > Colac Secondary College (Stage 3); > Dandenong High School (Stage 3); > Pembroke Secondary College (Stage 2); > Ashwood Secondary College; > Bairnsdale Secondary College; > Boronia K\u201112 College; > Galvin Park Secondary College; > Phoenix P\u201112 Community College; and > Wodonga Senior Secondary College.

The school will offer a local education option for families and will further enhance the area as a community precinct. The City of Melton is one of the fastest growing municipalities in Victoria, with its population having doubled between 2001 and 2012 and a reported 42 babies being born a week in 2011\u201112. This fast growth is placing great pressure on existing education facilities. The new school will ease growth pressure at Wedge Park Primary School, where the student population has boomed to just over 700 students. The Government will work with Melton City Council to identify opportunities for shared use of facilities in the community precinct. It is envisaged that the school will be used by the community out of school hours, whilst students will have access to the recreation reserve, facilitating an active community precinct where facilities are shared and utilised by the whole community. Innovations to support education infrastructure There may be opportunities for private investment to support education infrastructure. Innovative procurement opportunities, such as public private partnerships, will be explored as part of a new, efficient asset management and investment model to meet demand growth in the long term. The Government is exploring opportunities for non\u2011government education providers to express interest in purchasing and using vacated school and other educational sites. The State currently holds around 200 such sites. While some of these sites are located in areas of declining numbers of school\u2011age children, others may offer potential for new schools.

Community safety has been a top priority for the Government since coming to office, with the 2013-14 Budget building on the steps already taken to improve law and order and justice. This budget funds a program of capital works to improve community safety and law enforcement through upgrades to police and emergency services facilities. At the heart of the Coalition Government's strategy to tackle crime, violence and anti\u2011social behaviour is a focus to deliver a stronger and more visible police presence. Police Stations Since coming to office, the Coalition Government has invested $104 million in new and upgraded police facilities over three successive budgets. This underpins its election commitment to recruit 1 700 new police officers to enhance frontline services. Achievements in relation to police include: > new and upgraded police stations in the 2011-12 Budget for Ashburton, Forest Hill, Mooroopna, Heywood, Paynesville, Mooroolbark and North Ballarat/Sebastopol; > $25 million further funding in the 2013-14 Budget to complete new police stations in Sale and Somerville; > funding to acquire land and plan for a new police stations at Emerald and the Essendon Operational Tactics and Safety Training Facility; > a new Waurn Ponds police station to include capacity to accommodate the co\u2011location of the South Barwon Victorian State Emergency Service headquarters; > a new police residence in Axedale; and > extending the operations of the police stations in Mount Waverley and Carrum Downs from 16 to 24 hours. Additional operating hours at Carrum Downs police station will increase policing services to Langwarrin. Protective Services Officers at railway stations The Coalition Government has been working to improve community safety on public transport. In 2011\u201112, $212 million over four years was allocated to deploy 940 protective services officers (PSO) across the rail network to patrol all metropolitan railway stations and four major regional railway stations (Ballarat, Bendigo, Traralgon and Geelong) from 6pm until the last train. Subsequently, $18 million was provided to upgrade a first tranche of 66 metropolitan stations to accommodate deployment of PSOs. This year's budget provides a further $68 million for capital works for upgrades at remaining railway stations. Country Fire Authority Funding was provided to the Country Fire Authority in 2011\u201112 and 2012\u201113 to upgrade or replace 108 fire stations. The 2013-14 Budget provides an additional $56 million to replace or upgrade a further 142 rural fire stations over the next two years, which brings Government's investment to $118 million and completes the election commitment to build or upgrade 250 stations. This investment will ensure that the Country Fire Authority has quality, up\u2011to\u2011date infrastructure throughout the State to support its critical emergency response activities. Since 2011\u201112, $8.8 million has also been provided for CFA communications infrastructure, to ensure interoperability and to address blackspots, and for volunteer support infrastructure. Prisons The Government has taken strong action to ensure Victoria has the facilities in place to deliver a stronger, more adaptable prison system to support safer Victorian communities, committing over $700 million since 2011\u201112 towards additional prison beds. Additional prison capacity, including the new Ravenhall prison, will address capacity demand in prisons, creating 1 400 new male prison beds across the system. The 2012-13 Budget provided funding for a new 500\u2011bed medium security men's prison at Ravenhall, and for a further 395 beds to be provided through the expansion of existing facilities. The Ravenhall Prison project is being delivered through the public private partnerships framework. The private sector will design, build, finance, maintain and operate the prison facility. This will ensure the prison is built and run in a way that delivers the best value for money for Victoria. The new prison will also be built on a large footprint to facilitate future expansion. The Government will continue to deliver its long\u2011term plan to modernise and upgrade Victoria's prison system by providing an additional $45 million for 357 prison beds across the male prison system to accommodate demand, as well as a new 40\u2011bed unit at Barwon Prison and infrastructure upgrades for high security and management of prisoners. This builds on previous investment and will continue to expand and modernise the corrections system to ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to deliver a strong prison system to support safer communities. Technology Victoria Police is undertaking the Police Information Process and Practice reform program with a long\u2011term view to reform its information management systems and processes. The 2013-14 Budget provides $10 million for Stage 1 of the program, which will address immediate issues to maintain the performance of core Victoria Police information systems and commence the planning for longer\u2011term reform. This project will free up resources for frontline policing, rather than tying up police with administrative paperwork. It will also improve incident response. This budget also provides $3.3 million for systems upgrades to ensure that Victoria State Emergency Service, Corrections Victoria, the Sheriff's Office and Lifesaving Victoria have continued access to high frequency radio channels critical to support emergency service delivery. 32 > 2013-14 Budget Information Paper No.2 > The growing knowledge\u2011based service industry in the Melbourne CBD is creating demand for infrastructure to support urban development within and around Melbourne's CBD. > To keep Melbourne the world's most liveable city, the Government is also building on Melbourne's stand\u2011out facilities to attract tourism and trade - including Federation Square and the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. > In addition, transformational city\u2011shaping transport projects are opening up new opportunities to build precincts within Melbourne's growth corridor, and Victoria's growing regional centres - the Government this year will put in place infrastructure to develop the East Werribee Employment Precinct. > Meanwhile, new irrigation upgrade works in Northern Victoria will build on the Government's work to increase water savings in regional areas."

The High\u2011Value High\u2011Risk (HVHR) policy has been introduced to enhance business case development and improve the efficiency of project implementation - to significantly improve value\u2011for\u2011money results for the Government, and the people of Victoria. This policy applies to projects that are classified as 'high value' or 'high risk' by the Government, and requires greater scrutiny by the Treasurer and rigour in their planning and delivery - reducing cost blow outs. The policy avoids having taxpayer money tied up dealing with cost blow\u2011outs, which ensures more funding is available for other projects. High\u2011value and high\u2011risk asset investments have been defined as those that: > have a total estimated investment (TEI) greater than $100 million, regardless of the funding source; > are identified as high risk, using an approved risk assessment tool; or > are determined by the Government as warranting the rigour of increased oversight. Proposals assessed as high value and/or high risk are subject to more stringent processes at all stages of development, including increased central oversight and Treasurer's approval at key stages in the project lifecycle. Gateway reviews (peer reviews, by a panel of experts, designed to improve investment selection, management and delivery) are required. This intends to systematically improve on time, on budget and on quality delivery of investment benefits to Victorians. The policy will ensure infrastructure funding is targeted to projects that have been rigorously scoped and costed, are deliverable and will deliver real benefits to the community. Some examples of projects from this year's budget that will be subject to the HVHR policy are Monash Children's Hospital, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Redevelopment and East West Link. The Government's close oversight of high priority projects will assist the Government adhering to medium\u2011term fiscal parameters including a net operating surplus of at least $100 million."

Withholding disclosure of project budgets to drive better value for money tenders For selected major construction projects, the Government will not disclose the budgeted project cost at the time of announcement. This will improve the competitive tension in the tender process and encourage more active price competition between bidders. Where this approach has already been trialled, better value for money outcomes have already been achieved. The Government will expand the use of this approach to all significant construction projects, except where there are clear commercial or policy reasons for a more traditional process. Providing more information about infrastructure planning This year, Budget Paper No 4 contains expected completion dates for projects. This is the first stage of publishing additional information for projects. By mid\u20112013, the Government will also publish online further information for major projects funded through the budget, including procurement method, expected tender release dates and project status. This data will be regularly updated to provide the construction industry and the community with important information on how major projects are progressing. It will be of great value to the construction industry in particular in planning for upcoming public sector project tendering processes. Our commitment to PPP delivery The Government is engaging with the private sector to access capital and build new infrastructure, including investigating new forms of value capture, refining the existing public private partnership (PPP) model and establishing a clear framework for considering unsolicited private sector proposals. Public private partnerships play an important role in delivering government infrastructure and services. The procurement model generates high performance project delivery by bringing together private sector innovation, the disciplines of project finance and the right incentives for performance over the whole life of the infrastructure. National and international studies confirm the potential cost and time savings achieved through PPPs, with over $1 billion in savings estimated for the 22 projects being delivered under the Partnerships Victoria framework. This is combined with the innovations and qualitative benefits as detailed below. Innovations in PPP delivery include: > innovative design outcomes as demonstrated on the Royal Children's Hospital, the Southern Cross Station, and the Melbourne Convention Centre (all internationally awarded); > future proofing through significantly larger building area and shell space for the facilities compared with state benchmarks, including for the Royal Children's Hospital, the Partnerships Victoria in Schools, the Biosciences and Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre projects; > various Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD) initiatives that go significantly beyond the State's minimum requirements; and > related retail opportunities and greater utilisation of assets in general such as in the Royal Children's Hospital and Biosciences projects. 36 > 2013-14 Budget Information Paper No.2 PPP reforms The Government has announced new reforms to the PPP model to ensure that Victoria has the right model for engaging the private sector to drive innovation and efficiency. The changes follow extensive industry consultation including the November 2012 release of a public consultation paper. Government has been responsive to industry and practitioner feedback on improvements to the PPP model to reduce bidding costs and drive greater efficiencies and service outcomes for the Victorian community. Government will take the opportunity to expand the scope of services provided by the private sector associated with new or upgraded infrastructure. The Ravenhall Prison project soon to be released to market will include custodial services provided by the private sector. A streamlined approach for small\u2011scale projects that currently lack the scale needed to attract private sector interest will be tested via a simplified PPP model. The key PPP commercial principles can be applied to smaller investments or a bundle of projects. Value for money will continue to be tested via a robust Public Sector Comparator benchmark. The assumed alternative procurement option will be removed and where appropriate the comparator will be an affordability benchmark with a scope ladder. Modified financing structures will be examined for the right projects consistent with recent experiences with state capital contributions for PPP projects in Victoria and other jurisdictions. There will also be action to reduce bid costs and build capability in government. The reforms will reflect lessons from past projects and ensure future PPP contracts contain appropriate security and parent company guarantees. New requirements will also facilitate the replacement of a financier in certain circumstances. The PPP reforms ensure that the PPP model will continue to deliver benefits to the community and will meet the challenges of a new global financial environment."

According to three different measures of cost growth, construction costs have increased faster over the past 10 years than average costs for Australian market sector industries. Research also shows that productivity growth in the Australian construction industry has been poor and compares unfavourably to construction costs in the United States. These problems are pricing Victoria out of vital infrastructure and skewing the shape of our cities. The Government is responding to these challenges and in 2012 introduced Victoria's new Implementation Guidelines to the Victorian Code of Practice for the Building and Construction Industry. The guidelines are designed to assist the construction industry achieve behavioural change on Victorian building sites. The guidelines require tenderers for public sector construction work in Victoria to commit to compliance with the law, productivity, safety and freedom of association. Tenderers who fail to comply with the guidelines can be sanctioned, which can lead to the loss of tendering opportunities in Victoria. The guidelines are helping make vital infrastructure projects more affordable, leading to greater investment and employment opportunities for Victorians. The guidelines now apply to over 150 State projects and 200 contractors across Victoria. A potential 1 000 private building sites throughout Victoria are also subject to monitoring by the dedicated construction code compliance unit (CCCU). To help contractors and departments achieve compliance, the CCCU provides direct education and advice. Through its website, hotline, mailbox, stakeholder liaison and formal presentations, the unit has provided assistance on over 600 occasions."
