In 2013\u201114, the Coalition Government will deliver an estimated operating surplus of $225 million. The Coalition Government's commitment to managing the budget to deliver operating surpluses has strengthened Victoria in challenging economic times. It also supports a sustained program of infrastructure construction and continuing high quality public services for Victorians. This fiscally responsible approach allows for investment in infrastructure, while avoiding excessive levels of debt. Over the past decade, the State saw considerable revenue growth, which was outpaced by increases in government expenditure, creating a structural deficit. The sources of revenue that fuelled this growth have now softened. Without the Coalition Government's decisive action, growth in government expenditure and net debt would have become unsustainable. Since coming to office, the Coalition Government has implemented savings and new targeted revenue initiatives totalling approximately $2.5 billion in 2013\u201114. These measures have reduced ongoing expenditure growth, returning it to more sustainable levels, and in line with forecast revenue growth. The Coalition Government has achieved this while ensuring that the quality of Victoria's frontline services is enhanced. Victoria is now one of only two states (along with resource-rich Western Australia) forecasting consistent operating surpluses over the next four years. Net debt is estimated to be 6.4 per cent of GSP at June 2014, and begins to decline on this basis after June 2015. The Coalition Government is on track to meet the medium\u2011term fiscal parameter to reduce general government net debt as a percentage of GSP over the period to 2022. The Coalition Government's medium\u2011term fiscal strategy delivers prudent budget management, while strengthening investment in productivity\u2011boosting infrastructure and high quality public services. The  2013\u201114 Budget is a balanced, responsible budget, which strengthens key service offerings to Victorians, while preserving budget surpluses and modest levels of borrowing."

The East West Link will ultimately transform the way people move around Melbourne, linking the Eastern Freeway to CityLink, CityLink to the Port of Melbourne, and the Port of Melbourne to the Western Ring Road, alleviating congestion and ensuring travel-time reliability for families and freight. The East West Link will promote Victoria's liveability and productivity. The project will substantially enhance cross\u2011city capacity and reduce reliance on the West Gate Bridge and M1 Corridor. The East West Link will better connect the state to Melbourne Airport, the Port of Melbourne and freight generators and will provide a bypass of Melbourne for regional freight, reducing costs for regional exporters. Stage 1 of the East West Link will connect CityLink at Parkville to the Eastern Freeway at Hoddle Street. The East West Link will be delivered as a public private partnership (PPP), including some private sector financing. As a nation-building piece of major infrastructure, a $1.5 billion funding contribution from the Commonwealth will be required to ensure the timely delivery of this transformational infrastructure project. It is expected that the Eastern Section of the East West Link will create approximately 3 200 jobs during the construction phase. Melbourne Metro Planning and development of the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel will be progressed in 2013-14. This project is crucial to meeting increasing demand for train services in Melbourne's growth areas, enabling the creation of four independent rail lines. The project will create the capacity needed for future expansion of Melbourne's rail network, future\u2011proofing the system. $10 million will be spent in 2013\u201114 to progress detailed planning on Melbourne Metro."

This initiative complements the Port of Melbourne redevelopment, which is undergoing a $1.6 billion expansion of container and automotive capacity at Webb Dock."

Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital A complete redevelopment of the iconic Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital will provide a substantial boost to capacity on the existing site in East Melbourne. Bendigo and Box Hill Hospitals and the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre The Coalition Government is also funding major health infrastructure including the new $630 million Bendigo Hospital, the $1 billion Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre and the $448 million redevelopment of Box Hill Hospital. In total, the 2013-14 Budget provides an additional $629 million to improve the condition of hospital infrastructure. Other key projects funded in this budget include redevelopment of the Werribee Mercy Hospital mental health facilities, constructing 54 new hospital beds, and expansion of the Northern Hospital inpatient capacity, through 32 additional beds and support areas. The Coalition Government is committing $78 million of this capital investment towards rural and regional areas, ensuring proximate access to high quality health services for all Victorians. Key health projects for rural and regional areas include: > Waurn Ponds Community Hospital - a new 32-bed community hospital in southern Geelong. This hospital will meet service pressures for the growing populations of Geelong and the Surf Coast Shire. The new facility will provide same\u2011day surgery, chemotherapy chairs, renal chairs and capacity for specialist clinics. > Radiotherapy service for south west Victoria in Warrnambool. This will enable residents to receive treatment locally, instead of needing to travel long distances as at present. > Reinstating acute health services at Numurkah Hospital, which was damaged extensively in the March 2012 floods. The Coalition Government will invest $60 million to replace and improve vital medical infrastructure. This will ensure up-to-date medical equipment at both metropolitan and rural health facilities."

The 2013-14 Budget provides an additional $426 million in 2013-14 and $1.8 billion over the forward estimates to Victoria's hospitals and health system, bringing expenditure on acute health to $11.2 billion in 2013-14. Newly funded initiatives include: > $421 million over four years for a funding pool to drive efficiencies in elective surgery. This follows a successful pilot in the 2012-13 Budget and will encourage the most efficient use of facilities to see more patients treated sooner. > $772 million over four years to treat more patients. This package includes funding to augment critical care capacity in Intensive Care Units and enhance maternity and neonatal care. > $62 million over four years in additional funds to expand culturally appropriate service options for Aboriginal Victorians.

It remains the most responsive in Australia to the changing needs of the labour market, driven by strong growth in the non\u2011TAFE sector. The 2013\u201114 Budget builds on recent skills reform, where the Coalition Government added more than $1 billion over four years to the vocational educational and training budget, targeted to areas of greatest public benefit and future jobs growth. This brings the State's annual budget for higher education and skills to around $2.3 billion. As part of this, the Coalition Government introduced a new set of subsidy rates for all training providers to better reflect the relative public value of particular courses. Encouraging training in the highest value courses, while maintaining a market\u2011driven approach, preserves the benefits of a more competitive vocational education and training sector, while ensuring government spending is sustainable and well targeted. As the chart above illustrates, the rebalancing of subsidy rates has resulted in a shift in commencements from courses with less need for government investment (bands D and E) to courses of higher public value (bands A and B). The percentage of enrolments in government-funded vocational education and training (VET) places by unemployed people grew from 17 per cent in 2008 to 24 per cent in 2012, on top of significant growth in total participation. In addition, there were approximately 6 200 Indigenous students and over 40 000 students with a disability undertaking training in 2012, an increase of 11 and 18 per cent respectively from 2011. Training courses that hold little prospect of a job at completion are not only an inefficient use of public money, but are of little benefit to people seeking to enter the workforce. A responsive, innovative and financially sound TAFE sector is central to the success of skills reform, and the Coalition Government is supporting TAFE institutes to compete on a sustainable basis in the modern vocational training system. A $200 million TAFE Structural Adjustment Fund will support TAFE institute initiatives that promote innovation, collaboration, structural reform and business transformation. Other reforms to give TAFEs greater control over their assets and workplace relations and reduce the regulatory burden on institutes will help to secure the future of TAFEs in Victoria."

The program will help organisations build leadership and be innovative in the ways they engage audiences. The Melbourne International Film Festival is coming into its 62nd year, and is firmly established as one of the world's great film festivals and a highlight of the Melbourne cultural calendar. Extending government support of $5.3 million over the next four years will ensure the festival maintains its place as the Southern Hemisphere's largest and most prestigious film festival. The Arts Centre will receive an additional $4 million to bring world\u2011class cultural and artistic programs to Melbourne, and ensure Melbourne's Arts Centre remains at the forefront of performing arts in Australia. The budget also invests $4.5 million to stage a new statewide National Gallery of Victoria summer program, with an enhanced focus on contemporary artists and children. The program will include blockbuster exhibitions, diverse online activities and the inaugural Melbourne Now exhibition, to showcase local artists. In addition, the 2013\u201114 Budget provides $4 million to refurbish the National Gallery of Victoria International and the Ian Potter Centre. This builds on existing government investments to expand cultural infrastructure in Victoria, including: > The redevelopment of Hamer Hall. > The design of a new Circus Oz facility in Collingwood. > The development of a blueprint for the future of the Southbank Arts Precinct."
