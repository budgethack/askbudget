The Coalition Government is continuing to responsibly manage net debt. Net debt is falling over the next four years as a percentage of gross state product, and net infrastructure spending is forecast to be fully funded by cash from operations from 2015-16. To maintain Victoria's triple-A credit rating, the strongest amongst the states, the Coalition Government has acted decisively to bring spending under control while growing frontline services. Victoria is the only state or territory to forecast surpluses for each of the next four years. In 2014\u201115, the Victorian economy is expected to grow by 2.5 per cent, rising to 2.75 per cent over the forecast period.

With the addition of new high-capacity trains, it will also increase capacity within the City Loop to upgrade services on other rail lines. Construction of a tunnel from South Yarra to Southern Cross Station will significantly increase transport capacity and reliability for Melbourne's growth areas, better connecting people to jobs. The Coalition Government will also commence construction on the Airport Rail Link. The Airport Rail Link will introduce a new electrified service running along dedicated tracks from a new station at Melbourne Airport to Albion in Melbourne's west, where it will join the existing rail network and run through to Southern Cross Station. The Airport Rail Link will cement Melbourne's status as a global city by providing a fast, frequent and reliable train service every 10 minutes during the day. The Melbourne Rail Link will deliver improvements to public transport services to support the continued growth of Melbourne's inner north and its expansion as a key economic cluster. This will include enhancing and re-aligning the tram network and improving bus services to the precinct. Detailed planning and project development is under way with early works commencing in mid-2016 and construction in mid-2017. The Coalition Government's record investment of up to $11 billion is delivering an integrated and modern rail network."

These level crossings are at: - Main Road, St Albans (as part of the Regional Rail Link project); - Blackburn Road, Blackburn; - North Road, Ormond; and - Burke Road, Glen Iris. The Coalition Government has now funded removal of eight of the 10 level crossings identified as priorities in its Metro Level Crossing Blitz election commitment. The 2014-15 Budget provides an additional $21 million to plan for the next seven priority level crossing removal projects. Murray Basin Rail Project The Murray Basin Rail Project will commit up to $220 million over four years to undertake major country rail freight upgrades and standardise the key Mildura to Geelong rail link. The first stage of the Murray Basin Rail Project will undertake immediate MURRAY BASIN RAIL PROJECT MORE AFFORDABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORT City Loop upgrade The Coalition Government will invest $44 million to upgrade fire and emergency equipment within the City Loop. Upgrades will include water hydrants, emergency lighting, fire detection systems, and improvements to automation for power shutdown, escalators and platform announcements. More affordable public transport The Coalition Government is helping to ease cost of living pressures by: - providing free tram travel in Melbourne's CBD and Docklands; - enabling bus, train and tram commuters to travel in Zones 1 and 2 for the price of a Zone 1 fare; - enabling full-fare commuters who currently buy a Zone 1 and 2 fare to save about $5 per day, equating to savings of around $1\u2009200 each year, and commuters who currently use an annual myki pass to save more than $750; - allowing commuters who currently travel in Zone 2 only, to benefit from Zone 2 fares remaining at their lower rate; and - easing daily traffic congestion in the suburbs. upgrades on the Mildura to Maryborough and Murtoa to Hopetoun rail lines, and finalise the business case for the Mildura to Geelong standardisation. The final cost and alignment of the Mildura to Geelong rail standardisation will be guided by the final business case to be delivered before the end of 2014. Regional Rail Link Construction of the Regional Rail Link is currently ahead of schedule. The first service to use this new rail line is expected to start by mid-2015, and the St Albans level crossing removal is due to be completed in 2017. The project created around 3 600 jobs at the peak of construction. Through dedicated regional tracks from West Werribee Junction to Southern Cross Station, this landmark project will remove major bottlenecks in Victoria's rail network. V/Line commuters from Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong will see improved travel times and reliability by separating the regional and metro rail network.

The reliability of Victoria's transport network will be improved by a much-needed alternate route to the current river crossing.

This project will create around 700 jobs during the peak of construction. This project will complement the Airport Rail Link with new lanes and improved operations, getting people and goods from the CBD and the Port of Melbourne to the airport faster, as well as supporting Victoria's growing tourism sector.
