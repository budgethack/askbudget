The budget includes unprecedented investment in major new public transport, road and freight projects in addition to significant investments in education, health and justice. Responsible financial management and rebuilt budget capacity means that the Government can deliver a 'once in a generation' infrastructure program that will create jobs, boost productivity and deliver better quality services. The Government's 2014-15 capital program includes important investments to develop new infrastructure and modernise existing infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing population and to facilitate economic growth. These investments will address a wide range of service needs, including public transport, local roads, new and improved health and education facilities, and continued investment in infrastructure to support public safety and emergency services. The total value of Victorian public sector capital projects under way or commencing in 2014-15, including projects across both the general government and public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sectors, is around $72 billion. This includes projects being delivered through public private partnerships (PPPs) and indicative values for the East West Link and Melbourne Rail Link (including Airport Rail Link). The Government is delivering significant rail and road projects that will transform Victoria's transport networks, supporting development of new suburbs, building new transport links and expanding the central business district through supporting urban renewal in Fishermans Bend. The Government has committed funding of up to $21 billion for the Melbourne Rail Link (including Airport Rail Link) and completing the full East West Link. Combined with other major projects announced in this budget or already under way, this represents a significant program of infrastructure projects. Given the scale of the program, the Government is carefully managing timing to deliver projects cost-effectively, with staggered start dates for different projects. East West Link - Eastern Section at $6-8 billion is currently under procurement with construction due to start in late 2014, while East West Link - Western Section at $8-10 billion is currently in the planning phase with construction due to commence in late 2015. The Melbourne Rail Link (including Airport Rail Link) with a total cost of $8.5-11 billion will start early works in mid-2016 and start construction in mid-2017."

Driving improved productivity through the provision of major infrastructure is a key component of this strategy. The transformational infrastructure projects in the 2014-15 Budget will make Victoria more flexible and responsive to domestic and international opportunities and enable more rapid movement of resources to areas where they generate high returns. This will facilitate economic growth and build the confidence, investment and employment vital for Victoria's long-term economic success. The Government's infrastructure investment program is a key part of the Government's strategic response to the challenges of population growth, economic transition and land-use changes: \u2022 improving the capacity of the transport system - by expanding coverage and improving services; \u2022 removing major bottlenecks - by addressing several major conflicts on the network to ensure productivity and liveability; \u2022 improving access to major employment clusters - by supporting the growth and expansion of key industries and employment nodes; \u2022 maintaining and upgrading key infrastructure - by ensuring that the transport network can continue to supply a high-quality service and risks to the system are managed effectively; and \u2022 ensuring the safety, security and integrity of the transport network - by focusing on the needs of users and meeting community expectations through the sustainable management of assets and operations. The Government is also driving better value for money, streamlining project approvals and cutting red tape to expedite major projects coming to market. The Government is continuing to implement rigorous processes to improve infrastructure project delivery and ensure the cost pressures that affected major projects in the past are not repeated. These measures ensure that these projects are delivered quickly while maintaining value for money to maximise the benefits for Victorians. The continued focus on rigorous planning for the future is evidenced by the planning and environmental investigations under way to develop the Port of Hastings."

In November 2013 the Commonwealth Government announced the commencement of a Productivity Commission inquiry into infrastructure costs and financing in Australia. The Productivity Commission's draft report highlighted the economic and industrial significance of the Implementation Guidelines to the Victorian Code of Practice for the Building and Construction Industry (Guidelines) and recommended that the Commonwealth, and all state and territory governments, adopt Victoria's building code and implementation guidelines. The draft report described Victoria's Building Code and Guidelines as the 'most influential' and 'most promising' policy approach to addressing rising construction costs. Through the Guidelines, the Government is addressing the industrial relations causes of high construction costs. The code increases flexibility and productivity in the industry and ensures the Government can maximise value for money on its infrastructure spending. The Construction Code Compliance Unit (CCCU) was established to monitor and enforce compliance with the new Guidelines. Every new Victorian public construction project over $10 million now has a specific Workplace Relations Management Plan that addresses productivity and industrial relations risk management for the project. The CCCU also monitors project compliance, to ensure the onsite conduct of contractors complies with the Guidelines and Workplace Relations Management Plan."

The new guidelines provide a transparent framework for considering and progressing unsolicited proposals from the private sector to provide infrastructure and/or services to government. It also provides a framework for considering and implementing direct approaches by government to a private party to deliver a proposal. The guidelines seek to provide a balance between providing confidence and certainty of process to the private sector, encouraging new and innovative ideas, and pursuing proposals that have something genuinely unique to offer and represent the best value to Victorians. In March 2014, the Government announced the Cranbourne-Pakenham Rail Corridor project as the first project to be progressed under the new unsolicited proposal guidelines. The project is a $2-2.5 billion initiative to increase capacity on the rail corridor. The Government is in exclusive negotiations with a private consortium to deliver the project and a final binding agreement is expected in the second half of 2014, subject to a positive value for money outcome. Construction is expected to start in 2015 and conclude in 2019. The CityLink - Tulla Widening project will build capacity, boost performance and improve safety on one of Melbourne's busiest roads. The Victorian Government has reached an in-principle agreement with Transurban to deliver the project under the Government's unsolicited proposal guideline. A final binding agreement is expected in late 2014, subject to a final value for money assessment. The project is fully self-funded at an approximate cost of $850 million through an extension of the CityLink Concession by one year, toll price increases remaining at a minimum of 4.5 per cent (annually) for an additional year and truck tolls increasing to become consistent with national pricing for trucks on other motorway networks. The project will be delivered jointly by the State and Transurban, with construction to commence in 2015 and be completed in 2017."

Partnerships Victoria provides a framework for a whole of government approach to the provision of infrastructure and related services through PPPs. It focuses on whole-of-life costing, full consideration of project risks and optimal risk allocation between the public and private sectors. This is part of the overall framework for high-value and high-risk projects. Public private partnerships are one of a range of procurement models government uses to contract with the private sector to provide infrastructure and associated services. Private finance does not represent an additional funding source. The majority of PPP projects are government funded through availability payments, financed by the private sector and recognised as a finance lease in the government's accounts. Reforms to the PPP model announced in May 2013 are being implemented to engage the private sector to drive innovation and efficiency in infrastructure delivery. Changes include adopting modified financing structures, including a greater range of services and streamlining PPP tender processes. Bidder feedback confirms these reforms are working well on the current tender processes for the East West Link - Eastern Section project and the Ravenhall Prison project. Value for money will continue to be tested through a robust Public Sector Comparator benchmark. Together with action to reduce bid costs and build government capability, the reforms will improve infrastructure and services delivered through the PPP framework. There are currently 27 PPP projects. Of these, 20 have been commissioned and are now operational and three are under construction. There are four projects currently in procurement, including the Ravenhall Prison and East West Link - Eastern Section, both of which are due to complete the tender process by the end of 2014. East West Link - Eastern Section is being delivered as an availability PPP. This involves the private sector designing, constructing, financing, operating and maintaining the road for the PPP contract term (in exchange for regular availability payments over the life of the concession), with the State retaining toll revenue and demand risk, at least initially. The structure will provide a commercially viable framework for realising the best value of the toll revenue by the State. The Ravenhall Prison tender process is applying an affordability benchmark and a scope ladder. The scope ladder is a prioritised list of scope items that a bidder can either remove or add so that its proposal delivers the maximum benefit while remaining within the affordability benchmark. There are three upcoming infrastructure projects that will be procured using the PPP model. The private sector will be invited to deliver the priority construction of 11 new schools to address growing demand as a component of the school capital program under a PPP contracting arrangement. There will be packages within the Melbourne Rail Link to be delivered under PPP procurement. Significant parts of the East West Link - Western Section project will also seek to leverage the expertise of the private sector through the PPP model. These PPP projects are reflected in the budget as if they were being procured directly by the State, subject to further project development and procurement planning being undertaken."

Expected completion dates are also listed. Budget Paper No. 4 does not include capital grants paid to entities outside the Victorian State Government. In Chapters 2 and 3, there can appear to be differences in a project's cash flows and the estimated completion date. These differences arise because funding from non-State Government sources is received by the project in the later stages of the project. The estimated completion date has been updated after the project's cash flows were finalised and differences between project practical and financial completion dates."

Chapter 2 provides a detailed list of discrete projects funded through the annual state budget process for each major agency in the general government sector. However, total capital expenditure as recorded in each agency's financial statements includes other capital expenditure. This includes expenditure relating to an agency's ongoing capital programs (such as minor works, refurbishments and vehicle fleet purchases) and capital expenditure of outer budget entities (such as schools and hospitals) funded through their own revenue sources, such as donations. Chapter 2 identifies for each agency the aggregate value of the capital expenditure not attributable to discrete projects listed in Budget Paper No. 4. The individually listed new and existing capital projects listed in Chapter 2 and summarised in Table 4 predominantly comprise projects funded by government through the annual state budget process where the resulting asset or infrastructure is owned and managed by a general government sector agency. This includes investments in schools, prisons, roads, hospitals, courts and police stations. The Government also provides significant funding for infrastructure (including major public transport infrastructure) where the resulting assets ultimately reside in the balance sheet of the PNFC sector. These projects, although funded through the annual budget process, are listed in Chapter 3 against the relevant PNFC entity. The Government's measure of general government infrastructure investment includes: \u2022 net investment in assets for the general government sector assets (which appears in the government sector financial statements as 'Cash flows from investments in non-financial assets'); \u2022 funding provided through the budget for PNFC sector infrastructure (which appears in the government sector financial statements as 'Cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes'); and \u2022 cash flows from PPP payments."

For significant investments, PNFC entities are required to submit a detailed business case for the Treasurer's approval. These business cases are reviewed and evaluated by the Department of Treasury and Finance. The threshold above which business cases are required is set for each entity according to a three-tiered approach, being $10 million, $20 million or $50 million, depending on the relative size and risk of the PNFC entity. The three thresholds have been developed to ensure that the business case review and approval process focuses on those projects that are complex, high-value and/or high-risk. Table 7 summarises the value of the 2014-15 capital projects by PNFC entity. Projects with a TEI equal to or greater than $1 million are listed individually in this publication . The estimated expenditure on other capital is also detailed in each entity's table of projects. Changes in TEI and project priorities, for example estimated completion dates, may occur from year to year, subject to approval by the entity's board. Information for ongoing projects, such as upgrade or maintenance works, is provided by agencies based upon the budget estimates period, using planning data where appropriate."

(b) Budget required to deliver the interim solution is higher than the 2009-10 estimate and the budget is still a high-level estimate of the long term solution cost and may change once investigations are completed. (c) Options analysis has now been completed and the cost estimate has been revised based on the preferred option selected."
