The Government recognises this contribution and is working to deliver new prosperity, more opportunites, and a better quality of life for regional and rural Victorians. The Government's economic strategy to drive growth and employment, and cater for the State's growing population, is focused on boosting productivity and strengthening Victoria's economic fundamentals. This includes investing in major economic infrastructure for the future, creating a responsive education and training system, ensuring Victoria is a competitive and attractive place to do business, growing new markets, and investing in services to support liveability and population growth. Victoria is Australia's largest food and fibre exporting state, and our agricultural exports make up 29 per cent of the national total for this sector, earning around $9 billion each year. Regional economies provide attractive locations for businesses, support a diverse range of industries, and offer significant lifestyle benefits. Victoria's regions benefit from compact geography, natural resources and quality transport networks. As a result, Victoria's regional economies are among the healthiest in the nation. Victoria has the lowest regional unemployment rate of all the states. Over 2012-13, regional population growth in Victoria was equal highest among the non-mining states. Adjusted for household composition, disposable incomes in regional Victoria show less inequality than any other state. With Victoria's population projected to rise significantly from its current level of 5.8 million to 8.7 million by 2051, regional areas have an opportunity to benefit from a much greater share of future growth. Unlocking the growth potential of regional cities will allow them to support expected population growth and provide greater choice for people about where to live, work or start a business. The Government is committed to ensuring that regional cities and country communities will share in the prosperity, opportunities and better quality of life that future growth will bring.

In the 2014-15 Budget the Government is committing to an unprecedented infrastructure investment program of up to $27 billion including $1.2 billion specifically in regional Victoria. This investment will drive economic growth, support jobs growth and boost productivity in Victoria. This will ensure Victoria's rail and road networks are enhanced and well positioned to meet the population growth challenges. Improving the connectivity of the regions to Melbourne, across regions and to interstate destinations is critical for maintaining the competitiveness of Victoria's regional industries. It also cements the future liveability and prosperity of key regional centres. An efficient freight system will drive productivity throughout the broader economy, including Victoria's regions. An important source of funding for the Government's infrastructure program is the recycling of existing assets. The Government will enter into a medium-term lease over the operations of the Port of Melbourne and will divest the Rural Finance Corporation. The proceeds of leasing the Port of Melbourne will be invested in new productive economic infrastructure including East West Link - Western Section and Melbourne Rail Link. The proceeds from divestment of the Rural Finance Corporation will facilitate additional investment in key regional and rural infrastructure."

This project is a vital piece of infrastructure for regional Victoria that will transform regional rail services, acting as an important foundation for future growth in capacity and reliability of Victoria's train network. The 2014-15 Budget provides an additional $100.5 million over five years for the ongoing maintenance of new stations, bridges and other infrastructure, including operational control and power systems to maximise the benefit from this major infrastructure investment. The Government is also funding several projects to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rail services in regional Victoria, ensuring that maximum value is gained from existing transport assets. The efficiency of freight movement will be improved through a commitment of $58 million for an important intermodal initiative in line with Victoria - The Freight State . The Port-Rail Shuttle Project will provide targeted infrastructure works to support the development of a Metropolitan Intermodal System. This will ensure that privately-owned intermodal terminals in strategic locations across Melbourne are better linked by rail to the Port of Melbourne. Transport link to Avalon Transport links to Avalon will be improved with an additional $1.3 million to enable continued planning for the Avalon Airport Rail Link transport corridor. Avalon Airport is increasingly important as a general aviation hub and this investment will support its future as Victoria's second international airport. Bus interchange in Geelong The bus interchanges at North Shore and Moorabool Street, Geelong, will be upgraded. This will improve links to train services and access to the Regional Rail link, and reduce travel times. The Geelong Station will also be upgraded with an additional $5 million to improve disability access. Ballan crossing loop An additional $14.1 million will enable a new railway crossing loop to be constructed at Rowsley, which will improve train reliability and increase the number of trains able to operate in the Ballarat corridor. This investment will also provide an additional 45 car parking spaces at Ballan Station. \u2022 INCREASING TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND RELIABILITY \u2022 BOOSTING WORLD\u2011CLASS FREIGHT AND LOGISTICS \u2022 BETTER ACCESS TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION \u2022 ENSURING A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT IMPROVING SERVICES AND CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE AND GOODS MOVE AND CONNECT THROUGHOUT VICTORIA FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS $ 27"

The Coalition Government will also commence construction on the Airport Rail Link. The Airport Rail Link will introduce a new electrified service running along dedicated tracks from a new station at Melbourne Airport to Albion in Melbourne's west, where it will join the existing rail network and run through to Southern Cross Station. The Coalition Government's record investment of up to $11 billion is delivering an integrated and modern rail network. CityLink - Tulla widening Sections of the CityLink and Tullamarine Freeway will be upgraded and widened with an additional investment of up to $850 million. This enhancement will increase the capacity of the upgraged sections by 30 per cent, which will improve safety and significantly reduce congestion and travel times, leading to improved productivity. In addition, the Government is in discussion with the Commonwealth to complete the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway to the Melbourne Airport. This enhancement would deliver further benefits to business and commuters. Cranbourne-Pakenham Rail Corridor project Regional Victoria will benefit from the Cranbourne-Pakenham Rail Corridor project which will increase rail capacity by 30 per cent on the corridor and provide more reliable freight movements. The Cranbourne-Pakenham Rail Corridor is a critical connection between the Latrobe Valley and Melbourne. The initiative includes 25 high\u2011capacity trains, which will complete the Government's election commitment to deliver 40 new metropolitan trains. The initiative also includes high-capacity signalling, power upgrades, delivery of four grade separations and planning for a further five. This means the journey through the metropolitan area for V/Line commuters from Gippsland will be smoother and more reliable. The Cranbourne\u2011Pakenham Rail Corridor project will support significant employment during construction. Works are anticipated to start in 2015 and conclude by 2019. IMPROVING RAIL FREIGHT PRODUCTIVITY The Murray Basin Rail Project will commit up to $220 million over four years to undertake major country rail freight upgrades and standardise the key Mildura to Geelong rail link. The first stage of the Murray Basin Rail Project will undertake immediate upgrades on the Mildura to Maryborough and Murtoa to Hopetoun rail lines and finalise the business case for the Mildura to Geelong standardisation. The final cost and alignment of the full Mildura to Geelong rail standardisation will be guided by the final business case to be delivered before the end of 2014. The Murray Basin Rail Project is a transformational initiative that will unlock new economic opportunities for Victoria associated with agriculture, mineral sands, freight and logistics, and tourism. The project will form the first step of a broader vision to create a new 'transcontinental link' near Broken Hill, connecting to the Sydney - Perth rail line. The Mildura - Geelong rail line is on the Commonwealth Government's National Land Transport Network and is Victoria's busiest intrastate rail line for freight. This investment will capitalise on the rapid growth in Asia's 'middle class' identified in the Government's Food and Agriculture into Asia plan through increasing Victoria's food and fibre commodity exports to Asian markets. Moving product as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible is integral to the international competitiveness of Victorian products, especially for price sensitive commodities such as grains. 8 2014-15 Budget Information Paper"

These projects are expected to help create significant additional employment and the retention of existing jobs. A key program within the Economic Infrastructure Program is the Energy for the Regions Program. Natural gas provides cheaper energy for homes, businesses and local industries, relieving pressure on family budgets and encouraging industry to expand. The Energy for the Regions program allocates $100 million over four years to extend natural gas to more country communities. This initiative helps deliver the Government's commitment to improve the economic prosperity and liveability of regional and rural Victoria.

The Government is providing support to enable internationally competitive primary industries to thrive in Victoria. Despite having only 3 per cent of Australia's arable land base, Victoria is the nation's largest food and fibre exporter. Victoria exported $9.4 billion worth of food and fibre in 2012-13, which accounted for 29 per cent of the Australian total. The Government is investing $35.4 million to boost exports of premium food and beverage products to Asian markets as part of the Government's Food and Agriculture into Asia . This will embed long-term economic growth and sustainable jobs in regional and rural Victoria. This funding builds on existing commitments, including $61.4 million invested in the Growing Food and Fibre program to double the production by 2030, and $62.6 million for the International Engagement Strategy.

More people in Asia will seek out high-quality, safe and reliable produce from trusted sources. Victoria's reputation for safe produce, our long record of excellence in agricultural research and innovation, our skilled workforce and our close ties with Asia give us a distinct advantage in meeting these demands. The Food and Agriculture into Asia investment will support Victoria's food and agriculture sector to become a key driver of economic growth and jobs. Over the next four years the Government will work with industry across seven critical areas to grow exports of premium, safe and reliable food and beverage products to Asia. This will include: - improved access to Asian markets; - new markets for premium products; - the right workforce to supply Asia; - more efficient movement of products to Asian markets; - better targeted research and development, extension and innovation; - streamlined regulation and reduced red tape; and - increased capital investment.

Funding of $30.2 million will deliver trunk infrastructure, including subdivision of the initial land release to provide appropriate sites as part of Stage 1 of the Ballarat West Employment Zone. A concessional loans program valued at $1.6 million will be established to assist farmers affected by the recent downturn in the Goulburn Valley region along side a broader $22 million support package. The program will facilitate structural adjustment in the region by transitioning land to more productive uses, and provide a viable exit strategy for struggling producers. The Government is investing $2.3 million to establish a poppy industry in Victoria to help meet increasing global demand for therapeutic drugs, while ensuring the industry is scrutinised effectively. Stock losses for rural landholders will be minimised through baiting in remote areas of Gippsland and north-east Victoria as part of the ongoing management of wild dogs. ATTRACTING BUSINESS TO BALLARAT The Ballarat West Employment Zone comprises 438 hectares of Crown land located on the western urban fringe of Ballarat, adjacent to the Western Highway, the Ballarat Airport and the Ballarat-Ararat rail line. The precinct is designed to accommodate high performance freight vehicles, and provide support services to service freight movements, including a truck service centre. The location has a direct connection to the Western Highway, which enables quick access to the Port of Melbourne. The site will also provide services not usually available in industrial parks, including high speed data and mains gas. The project targets private sector investment from industries such as: - freight and logistics; - advanced manufacturing (such as food, mining equipment and bio materials); - research and development; and - construction. The 2014-15 Budget provides $30.2 million to deliver the initial stage works including: - construction of the main entry road to the precinct (the Boulevard) and connector roads; - construction of a service road to provide access to highway frontage land; - provision of all trunk infrastructure to the precinct; and - services reticulation (electricity, gas, water, sewer, data) along all roads. This funding builds on the Government's previous allocation of $38 million for the construction of the Ballarat Western Link Road between Western Freeway and Ballarat-Burrumbeet Road, which supports economic development in western Ballarat. SPC ARDMONA SHEPPARTON The Government has contributed $22 million towards a $100 million co-investment with Coca-Cola Amatil to support SPC Ardmona's long-term future in Shepparton, securing thousands of jobs. This assistance will empower SPC Ardmona to move forward with confidence and grow its export opportunities, particularly in Asian markets. It will enable SPC Ardmona to transform its operations, modernise food processing and increase its global and domestic product range. This investment aligns with the Government's aim to create export opportunities for regional businesses in growing markets, support business to grow and thrive in the domestic and international markets, and to support regional communities. 16 2014-15 Budget Information Paper"

The Government has targeted to reduce red tape by 25 per cent. The Government has already implemented a number of reforms that will directly benefit rural and regional Victoria. The 2014-15 Budget introduces a payroll tax rate cut from 4.9 per cent to 4.85 per cent from 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for 39\u2009000 employers right across Victoria, making Victorian businesses more competitive. Reducing red tape In August 2013, the Government cut unnecessary red tape imposed by local councils on volunteers who manage rural public halls and sporting grounds, and set a clear expectation that councils should exempt community volunteers from bureaucratic red tape. In addition, the Government is implementing a number of regulatory improvements. Wildlife control (kangaroos) The current application process for a permit to control wildlife is complex and time consuming. This reform will modernise the permit application process reducing costs and delays. Farm machinery crossing railways Currently all vehicles and machinery with a width over 3 metres require a permit to cross a railway. This reform will increase the width dimension for vehicles and machinery that may cross a railway without a permit from 3 metres to 5 metres. Stock crossing of arterial roads The system for stock crossings on arterial roads is complex and confusing. This reform will clarify the authority responsible for stock crossing decisions, the roads they can use, how stock crossing opportunities are accommodated, and permit requirements and processes. Native vegetation offsets Current native vegetation offsetting rules are inflexible. This reform will establish new rules and changes to the way the offset market functions, making meeting offset obligations more straight forward and reducing delays. SUPPORTING DYNAMIC REGIONS The Government adopts a place-based approach to support individual regions address specific economic and social challenges. In July 2012, the Victorian Government launched the Latrobe Valley Industry and Employment Roadmap, a long-term plan to build a stronger and more resilient economy in the Latrobe Valley. Accordingly, the Regional Growth Fund has established a $15 million Latrobe Valley Industry and Infrastructure Fund. This fund is enhancing the competitiveness of investment in the Latrobe Valley and to date has provided almost $10 million across more than 23 projects. Funding projects include $280\u2009000 to support Hydro Australia based in Morwell. The grant assisted the company to install new equipment enabling it to expand its market. A similar place-based approach has been adopted to support other regional economies in transition. In February 2014, the Government launched the Goulburn Valley Industry and Employment Plan supported by a $5 million Goulburn Valley Industry and Infrastructure Fund to support industries and facilitate investment in the Goulburn Valley.

The Government is investing in emergency services through a range of new measures. Funding of $14.4 million has been committed to replace the Echuca Police Station. A further $8.4 million will establish an emergency services precinct in Ballarat West which will include a police station and sites for future co-location of fire and ambulance stations to meet current and future emergency services' needs. The Country Fire Authority's capacity to respond effectively to fire incidents in regional Victoria will be improved with an additional $17.2 million for the purchase of an extra 49 medium tankers, bringing the total to be purchased to 74, along with four prototype vehicles. Safe delivery of emergency fire services will be supported through an additional $20.5 million to replace existing respiratory protection equipment. This will enable interoperability amongst agencies in significant emergencies. The Emergency Services Telecommunication Authority's statewide emergency call-taking and dispatch service will be upgraded with an additional $14.9 million, enabling these vital services to respond to the needs of regional and rural Victorians at times of need. First response operational police units in key regional locations will be equipped with conducted energy devices, commonly known as Tasers, to provide police with an alternative response to safety threats, through an additional $13 million. On days of high bushfire risk, pre\u2011formed incident management teams will be available to ensure that Victorian communities are better protected. An investment of $11.6 million will enable the Government to respond to the recommendations made by the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission, improving the quality and timeliness of bushfire responses. The Government has committed $10 million to upgrade infrastructure to support fire suppression efforts and the planned burning program. Funding of $39.7 million for the regional connectivity program includes improvemens to mobile phone coverage in black spot areas. This will increase the safety of residents in fire and flood-prone areas in regional Victoria. 22 2014-15 Budget Information Paper"

Support for individuals and households includes: - $2.32 million for a range of psychosocial and community support measures across bushfire-affected communities, including counselling, and local government recovery support; and - $150\u2009000 to hold small events in fire-affected communities to help build the resilience of communities. Support for primary producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations includes: - low-interest concessional loans of up to $200\u2009000 for eligible parties directly affected by the January 2014 bushfires in eight local government areas - Ararat, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Mildura, Northern Grampians, Southern Grampians, West Wimmera and Yarriambiack; - low-interest concessional loans of up to $200\u2009000 for parties directly affected by the February 2014 bushfires in 12 local government areas; and - $2.2 million to stimulate economic activity in bushfire-affected communities through 'buy-local' marketing campaigns, tourism promotion, and fast tracking projects in fire-affected communities. This includes $1 million to fast track regional development projects in fire-affected communities. Damaged essential public infrastructure will be restored, including the repair of arterial roads, and $2 million will be allocated for repairs to the regional rail network. The Government will also assist local councils to undertake counter disaster activities and the repair and restoration of essential local infrastructure to be provided under the State-Commonwealth Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Victoria's natural environment in key affected areas will be restored, including $585\u2009000 for the protection of waterways that have been exposed or put at risk following the bushfires. HAZELWOOD MINE FIRE The Government has committed $11.5 million specifically to assist those affected by the Hazelwood mine fire. Eligible Morwell residents have been provided with access to around $3.7 million for personal hardship, respite and relocation grants. Funding of $2 million will assist Morwell residents clean up after the impact of the fire. This includes access to clean-up equipment through Latrobe City Council, as well as vouchers for the cleaning of clothes and cars. Support for students and schools includes $1.3 million to help with the temporary relocation of students and the clean up of affected kindergartens and school sites. Eligible primary producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations are provided with access to low interest concessional loans of up to $100\u2009000. In addition, businesses that suffered a loss of income as a result of reduced local trade are assisted through a business relief fund of $2.1 million. The ongoing health of communities in the Morwell area will be protected with an additional $2.4 million for monitoring of the air and water quality levels by the Environment Protection Authority, while also assessing potential long-term environmental impacts.

The Government is supporting people living in regional and rural communities to feel safe in their homes, on the road, on public transport and in public spaces. The Government is investing $73 million to redevelop the Shepparton Law Courts into a new multijurisdiction court complex to meet future demand in the Shepparton area as well as additional staffing. This investment will improve the management of cases by expanding capacity for five new courts (three Magistrates' Courts and two higher jurisdiction courts) in a contemporary court environment. The Shepparton Law Courts project will support around 100 jobs during the peak of construction. The Government expects that all Victorians have appropriate access to justice and related support services. The 2014-15 Budget provides funding for additional staff across the State as part of a strategy to manage demand for personal safety intervention orders (PSIO), including PSIO Registrars in the Magistrates' Courts in Bendigo and Dandenong. The Government's prison expansion has seen significant increases in investments in prisons located in regional and rural locations, benefiting communities in the regions of Goulburn-Ovens Murray, Gippsland, Grampians and Loddon Mallee. The Government has allocated $140.8 million to undertake critical capital upgrades to male and female prisons to create capacity for an additional 871 beds. This initiative will provide employment opportunities for regional Victorians through construction and prison officer roles. Creating additional prison capacity will support around 150 jobs during the peak of construction. This expanded capacity will be supported with an additional $306.6 million over five years for staffing and operating costs across the prison system.

More than two-thirds of all racing participants reside in regional Victoria and more than 55 per cent of all economic and employment impacts are generated in regional Victoria. The three racing codes' breeding industries are significant employers particularly in regions outside of Melbourne. Ensuring that the Victorian racing industry experiences long-term growth will foster stronger economic benefits and jobs across the state. Government has allocated $79.5 million from July 2011 for the Victorian Racing Industry Fund.

Homelessness Victoria has committed $124.4 million over four years to support a new National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. This funding will support vulnerable Victorians who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, including rough sleepers, people with a mental illness, women with children experiencing family violence, and young people who have experienced family breakdown. Funding of $5 million is provided for the Government's third Youth Foyer, to be located in Shepparton, opening in 2015. This innovative model provides young people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, with integrated accommodation and support. Young people will be offered accommodation for up to two years and can access onsite and community support to participate in education, employment and training. Sustaining support for vulnerable children and families Additional funding will enable a number of critical support services to better respond to demand for assistance by vulnerable individuals and families across Victoria. An additional $12.8 million over four years includes funding for extra services across Victoria to better assist those who have experienced sexual assault. An additional $24.1 million over four years will provide extra family services and child protection workers to respond to demand pressures in the child protection system. This includes a better response to families who are the subject of multiple child protection reports. Strengthening the youth justice response Funding of $17.1 million will enable youth workers across the State to continue to provide early intervention and support to vulnerable young people engaging in risky behaviours. The focus will be on addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour before the risky behaviours escalate or become entrenched, preventing the progression of young people into the youth justice or criminal justice systems. The capacity of the Youth Justice Centre in Malmsbury will be expanded in 2015-16. Funding of $1.6 million is provided to prepare for this expansion. Disability services An additional $121 million will be provided to boost services for people with a disability, their families and carers. In addition the National Disability Insurance Agency national headquarters located in Geelong will receive $25 million over three years for its establishment costs. This is in line with the Government's support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) trial and full scheme roll-out and builds on the $300 million already provided. Up to 658 additional individual support packages will be available across Victoria. These packages provide care and support for Victorians with a disability, their families and carers, while providing choice about the types of support they access and greater control over their own lives. A number of these packages will be available to meet the needs of students with a disability currently exiting the school system, and those exiting the Futures for Young Adults program. This will ensure that young people with high ongoing needs are provided with the assistance they require. This funding will also support some individuals in the Barwon area during the ongoing transition to the NDIS. ENCOURAGING FUTURE REGIONAL LEADERS The Government's Regional Growth Fund helps nurture emerging regional leaders through Regional Community Leadership Programs to enable individuals to respond to local opportunities and challenges in their community. These programs have helped more than 260 participants in the past 12 months to develop the necessary skills to engage in issues relevant to their local area. Recent evaluations for two of the programs (in the Loddon Mallee and Wimmera regions) confirmed positive outcomes for participants and their regional communities by increasing the self-confidence and empowerment levels of individuals, strengthening networks and community collaboration and increasing involvement in the community at local, state and national levels.
