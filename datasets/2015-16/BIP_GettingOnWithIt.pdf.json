More and more people are training and playing every week - proud to wear the stripes and emblems of their local club. The Andrews Labor Government wants to encourage more men and women, boys and girls, to get active, get out on the pitch and get together in club rooms that are clean and comfortable. The Budget establishes a $100 million Community Sports Infrastructure Fund, helping local clubs upgrade tired grounds and build the facilities they need to grow their membership. $10 million from the Fund will be used to build decent, functional female change rooms at local grounds. No one should have to get changed in the car park. Everyone deserves equal facilities. Netball is one of Melbourne's fastest growing sports. The Budget will provide $9.6 million to build 64 new netball courts in inner-city areas. The Budget also provides $14.1 million to encourage more people to get outdoors, take up sport and maintain an active, healthy lifestyle."

The Budget provides record funding for multicultural initiatives: $37.9 million to build better understanding between communities and strengthen social cohesion and $11.1 million to support our state's cultural precincts and community infrastructure."
