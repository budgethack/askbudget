When one child is held back, we're all held back. When one child achieves, our whole state is stronger. But across Victoria, kids are learning in uncomfortable and overcrowded classrooms. Many 'temporary' buildings have stood for decades. Families haven't received enough help, and too many kids are finding out what disadvantage means the wrong way - when they don't have the right uniform or don't get to go on school camp. All work starts with skills and all skills start at school, but our TAFE and training system is struggling to recover from the greatest funding crisis in its history. The 2015-16 Victorian Budget is the first step in making Victoria the Education State, investing in our system from kinder through to TAFE, so all kids get the chance they deserve. Education investment will grow by 3.4 per cent on average over the next three years compared to growth of 2.0 per cent on average over the last three years."

The Andrews Labor Government will rebuild and upgrade school buildings across the state and build new schools and classrooms for kids in fast-growing suburbs and regional cities. The Budget invests $688 million for new and upgraded schools - a massive boost for the building blocks of our education system. $325 million will be used to renovate, refurbish and rebuild 67 existing schools. A further $10 million will provide works and equipment to support students with disabilities. The Labor Government is delivering on its commitment to build new schools. The Budget provides $111.1 million to support the delivery of 10 new schools in Craigieburn, Sale, Doreen, Tarneit, South Melbourne, Footscray, Richmond, Albert Park as well as Mernda and Bannockburn which are part of a public private partnership. $40 million will purchase land for new schools in Melbourne's fast growing suburbs, where increasing population puts pressure on the services that families rely on. The Budget provides $35 million for more than 120 new, safe relocatable classrooms to ease the pressure and reduce overcrowding at schools that are bursting at the seams. So children get the best start, the Budget invests $50 million in kinders across the state and $9 million to assist children with a disability or developmental delay. The Budget also provides $42 million for the first stage of a statewide school asbestos removal program. All kids deserve the best start, no matter what their background. The Budget invests $2.9 billion in schools over four years, making it the biggest education budget in Victoria's history. Through this Budget, the Andrews Labor Government reconfirms its commitment to the Gonski Agreement, the principles of which are central to making Victoria the Education State. The Abbott Government has failed to commit to its share of school funding for 2018 and 2019, but the Andrews Labor Government will keep standing up for our state and our schools. For the first time, this Budget sees Victoria fully deliver on its obligation under the Gonski Agreement for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 school years. Families who are struggling to afford the extra costs of education, like uniforms, school camps and books, deserve a helping hand to get them through the most important years of their child's life. Education. The Budget includes $178 million to provide uniforms, textbooks, free breakfasts and free eye glasses to students at Victoria's most disadvantaged schools. This funding also helps families pay for school camps, sports trips and excursions, which are an expensive but essential part of a child's education."

The $50 million TAFE Back To Work Fund will help campuses meet the needs of local employers, creating new training courses to give local students the skills they need for the jobs they want. Local Learning and Employment Networks, providing jobs and skills advice to people across Victoria, will receive $32 million to work with at-risk youth and get them back on track. Secondary students also deserve a head start on a hands-on vocation - a chance to build the foundations of their career early while maintaining their enrolment at their local secondary school. The Budget provides $12 million to support and establish Tech Schools across the state, which will be open to students from Years 7 to 12 who will learn skills alongside a comprehensive secondary education. The funding means planning can commence for Tech Schools in Gippsland, Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong, Monash, Casey, Wyndham, Banyule, Yarra Ranges and Whittlesea. \u2003 Credit: Grindstone Creative Nothing is more important to families than the health and wellbeing of their loved ones. Funding and supporting hospitals is the most basic duty of any government. A strong health system that's there for the people we love, when they need it, gives us all something else too: peace of mind. It's the confidence that only the world's best care can provide. There's no greater fear in any family home than an emergency that's treated too late. Paramedics and hospitals need more resources, because people should be able to rely on our health system. Victoria is a world-renowned centre of excellence for medical research and innovation, but to make the discoveries that will change someone's life, our best minds need the right amount of investment. The Andrews Labor Government is increasing funding in our health system, so families in Australia's fastest-growing state can get the care and peace of mind they deserve."

With this funding, which includes a $60 million elective surgery boost to cut waiting lists, hospitals will be able to admit an extra 60,000 patients and treat an extra 40,000 emergency patients. $200 million will be provided to increase hospital capacity, in line with the recommendations of respected surgeon and former AMA Victoria President, Dr Doug Travis. The diagnosis and ground-breaking treatment of genetic diseases will be enhanced, with  $25 million for a world-leading health alliance. Medical research institutes, teaching hospitals and universities in Victoria will come together to develop cutting-edge treatments for some of our most debilitating diseases. Super Pharmacies across our state will stay open for extended hours, in a $29 million plan to help families during late night emergencies. A National Centre for Farmer Health will support the wellbeing of the men and women who work on the land.

By 2026, the number of births at Sunshine Hospital is expected to exceed 7000 per year. The fastest growing area of Australia needs more services so no young family is left behind. The Budget invests $200 million in a dedicated Western Women's and Children's Hospital, with 237 beds, 39 special care nursery cots and four theatres for families in the west. The Budget also provides $85 million to expand the Werribee Mercy Hospital, delivering six extra operating theatres and 64 new inpatient beds in this fast-growing area of Melbourne. Casey Hospital, in Melbourne's south-east, will be able to treat 12,000 more patients, conduct 8000 more surgeries and support 500 more births, with a $106.3 million expansion. The project will provide four new operating theatres, a surgery recovery centre and 96 extra beds, including an intensive care unit - expanding the size of the hospital by more than a third. The Budget provides $20 million for an intensive care unit and short stay unit at the Angliss Hospital in Melbourne's outer east, reducing the distance families have to travel in a medical emergency. Urgent heart assessment, treatment and care is coming to Ballarat, with $10 million for a new cardiac catheterisation laboratory at Ballarat Base Hospital. The Victorian Heart Hospital (VHH) - a world-leading plan for Australia's first specialist heart facility - is one step closer, with $15 million to progress planning and development. The VHH will be built at Monash University in Clayton, treating cardiac diseases from early childhood to later life, undertaking ground-breaking research and training the next generation of heart specialists. The Budget also funds a helipad at the Monash Children's Hospital, upgrades to the Moorabbin Hospital and vital medical equipment and hardware in hospitals across the state. The ongoing dispute with Victoria's hardworking paramedics is over. Now the work begins to fix our ambulance system, so families get the help they need in an emergency - when they need it. The Budget invests almost $100 million to improve ambulance services and give our paramedics the resources they need to do their job and save more lives. $40 million will upgrade ambulance branches across the state and provide new vehicles and equipment, so families can be in the hands of the most up-to-date technology. A further $59 million will help cut emergency response times and hasten the transfer of patients to emergency departments - helping 'ramping' become a thing of the past."

The Andrews Labor Government is investing $257 million in Victoria's child protection system, so children, their families and their carers get the support they need. The Budget invests $48.1 million for Child FIRST and Family Services to improve early intervention, to help prevent abuse and neglect before it occurs, or before it gets worse. The Budget also provides $65.4 million to employ more than 110 child protection workers to respond to reports of abuse and neglect and expand child protection capacity statewide. Foster carers make a great sacrifice to care for our most vulnerable children.

Giving police and emergency services men and women the resources they need to do their job not only keeps us safe - it keeps them safe, too. Firefighters are exposed to great risk every time they're on duty, and the Government needs to be there to support them when things get difficult. Victoria's fleet of firetrucks and many of its CFA stations are outdated and run down. Units aren't growing as fast as they could be - and firefighters on the job aren't as safe as they should be. Victoria's police officers are among the best in the world, but too many are stuck babysitting petty criminals in the local police lock-up instead of getting out on the beat where they belong. The most effective way to keep our community safe is to support the people who protect our families and give them the tools they need and the respect they've earned. Emergency services The Andrews Labor Government is investing $78 million in emergency services, increasing funding to support more firefighters and give them the tools and resources they need to protect our families. The Budget provides additional funding to begin recruitment of 450 additional career firefighters, because more boots on the ground means more homes are safe. Training will be improved with $9.6 million to fund a program that dispatches firefighters at the same time as paramedics, increasing survival chances for heart attack patients. The Budget provides $33.5 million to purchase 70 new CFA trucks with modern, up-to-date firefighting technology to boost the capability and safety of the volunteers who crew them. Rundown and threadbare CFA stations and amenities will be upgraded, with $11 million to give firefighters a safe and comfortable place to meet and train and help their units grow. New stations will be built in Huntly, Buninyong, Plenty and Edithvale, and toilets and bathroom facilities will be installed at up to 100 CFA stations. Firefighters can be exposed to horrific scenes any time they're on shift. The Budget expands support services for firefighters suffering post traumatic stress disorder, to care for those who care for us. Additionally $30 million to implement all recommendations of the Hazelwood Coal Mine Fire Inquiry. The Andrews Labor Government has established a new CFA district, conduct a long-term health study of the fire and implement better procedures to manage smoke if such an event ever occurs again. A new emergency services hub for fire and ambulance services will be also be established at Morwell, to strengthen the emergency response in the Latrobe Valley. Police and emergency services"
