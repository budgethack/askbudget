The Victorian Heart Hospital - Australia's first specialist heart facility - is one step closer, with $15 million for planning and development.

More police will also be stationed in Bellarine and Geelong. $15 million as part of the Ice Action Plan, to provide Victoria Police with new booze and drug buses to improve road safety. The new fleet will let police drug test 100,000 people a year for drugs. Further funding will also help police track down and close clandestine drug labs more quickly. In addition, $333 million is provided to increase the capacity of Victoria's prisons, including upgrades to women's and men's correctional facilities and expanded Community Correctional Services.

A $500 million Regional Jobs and Infrastructure Fund will be used to back regional businesses and get on with the projects that local families and industries need. This Fund includes $200 million to assist regional businesses to grow their workforce, expand markets and create jobs of the future and $250 million to invest in the projects that will help local industries grow. The Back to Work Act 2015 has already established a $100 million fund for payroll tax relief to companies who hire unemployed young people, the long-term unemployed and retrenched workers to help create 100,000 jobs."

These cuts include $8.9 billion from our education system and more than $13 billion from our health system over the next 10 years. Nor is Victoria getting our fair share of funding for the projects our state needs. Victoria's average share of national infrastructure funding has only been around 20 per cent since 2001-02. The Andrews Labor Government is investing in job-creating projects of national significance, transforming our public transport system and reducing the costs of congestion on busy roads. Victoria will keep standing up for our fair share of infrastructure funding so we can get on with these projects faster. Victoria opposes the cuts to our schools, hospitals and other services, and we will fight for our share of education funding. The Andrews Labor Government is prepared to work with the Commonwealth to help our state grow, but we will never work for them. We put Victorians first."
