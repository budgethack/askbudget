It delivers on Labor's election promises. We've maintained Victoria's triple-A credit rating and reduced net debt. Our stable finances mean we can build more projects and provide more services for families in growing areas. And with Victoria emerging from a jobs crisis, we're supporting businesses and industries and boosting the skills of the next generation of Victorian workers, to help create 100,000 new jobs. This is a Budget for families because it gets Victoria back to work. Everyone in our state has a right to the dignity and security of a stable job in a growing industry. This is a Budget for families because it invests in schools and hospitals, giving our loved ones the care they need and giving every young Victorian the chance they deserve. This is a Budget for families because it invests in the transport projects that Victoria needs, so people can get to work and get back home safer and sooner. We're investing in hospitals, schools, jobs and transport because these are the things that matter to us all. These are basic building blocks of our society that keep families together, keep communities safe and keep our state growing. Our Budget is fair. It will help struggling families through some of the toughest times of their lives, because no Victorian should ever be left behind. It will help a generation of young people get the training they need for the jobs they want, because every child deserves every chance in life. It will protect the people who protect us, giving our paramedics, police and emergency services the resources they need to do their job and look after the people we love. Our Budget will keep Victoria number one. Victoria is the creative capital, home to arts, music, culture and sport, some of the world's best major events and the most liveable and multicultural city on earth. We want to stay that way. We are proud to present the 2015-16 Victorian Budget: For Families. We're getting on with the projects our state needs. We're putting people first. We're taking our state into the future - and leaving no one behind."

Victoria's economic environment is improving, reflecting its resilience despite recent challenging economic conditions. Victoria has significant economic strengths that will help to capitalise on new growth opportunities, including a highly skilled workforce, diverse industry base, liveable cities and regions and strong transport links. As promised, the Budget produces a strong operating surplus of $1.2 billion and it reduces net debt to 4.4 per cent of gross state product (GSP) by June 2019 - lower than the last year under the previous government. International ratings agencies recently confirmed Victoria's triple-A credit rating, which will be maintained and preserved under this Budget. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 2.5 per cent in 2015-16 from 2.25 per cent in 2014-15. This is on the back of improved household consumption and stronger export growth. Victorian businesses are responding to the lower Australian dollar and increasing demand from Asia. The Victorian labour market has improved since late 2014 and is expected to consolidate in 2015-16. Employment is forecast to grow around its long-run average of 1.5 per cent, supported by the Andrews Labor Government's Back to Work plan. The operating surplus is expected to grow to $1.8 billion in 2018-19, with accumulated surpluses of $5.8 billion over the Budget and forward estimates period. The higher operating surpluses forecast by the previous government could only be achieved by restricting expenditure growth to 2.5 per cent. That's not sustainable. With such low expenditure, the Government could not provide the projects that our state needs to grow or services that families need."

The Labor Government's modest growth in operating expenses to 3 per cent per year, on average, is low by contemporary standards. It remains well below forecast revenue growth of 3.4 per cent. Families need more funding for health, education, transport and job creation. Not proceeding with the East West Link has made considerable savings, allowing the Labor Government to get on with the projects that deliver an economic return. Net debt is projected to decrease to 4.4 per cent of GSP by June 2019, lower than the last year under the previous government. Our promises have been kept. Each initiative in Labor's 2014 Financial Statement has been accounted for. The Labor Government is keeping our finances stable, our services strong and our projects rolling, so we can keep up with growth in our outer suburbs and regions. We're proud to deliver for schools, hospitals, jobs and transport. These are investments we can afford - for the things our communities need.

By 2026, the number of births at Sunshine Hospital is expected to exceed 7000 per year. The fastest growing area of Australia needs more services so no young family is left behind. $106.3   million to expand Casey Hospital, in Melbourne's south east, so it can treat 12,000 more patients, conduct 8000 more surgeries and support 500 more births. The project will provide four new operating theatres, a surgery recovery centre and 96 extra beds, including an intensive care unit - expanding the size of the hospital by more than a third. $85   million to expand the Werribee Mercy Hospital, delivering six extra operating theatres and 64 new inpatient beds in this fast-growing area of Melbourne. $20   million for an intensive care unit and short stay unit at the Angliss Hospital in Melbourne's outer east, reducing the distance families have to travel in a medical emergency. $10   million to bring urgent heart assessment, treatment and care to Ballarat, with funding for a new cardiac catheterisation laboratory at Ballarat Base Hospital. The Victorian Heart Hospital - Australia's first specialist heart facility - is one step closer, with $15 million for planning and development. It will be built at Monash University in Clayton, treating cardiac diseases from early childhood to later life, undertaking ground-breaking research and training the next generation of heart specialists.

Through this Budget, the Andrews Labor Government reconfirms its commitment to the Gonski Agreement, the principles of which are central to making Victoria the Education State. The Abbott Government has failed to commit to its share of school funding for 2018 and 2019, but the Andrews Labor Government will keep standing up for our state and our schools. For the first time, this Budget sees Victoria fully deliver on its obligation under the Gonski Agreement for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 school years.

The Budget provides $118 million to give families a safe, enjoyable and comfortable way to see our natural assets. This includes: $11 million to upgrade dilapidated buildings, toilets, paths and roads and build new facilities in national and state parks across Victoria. $5.8 million to continue free entry at Victoria's zoos for children under 16 on weekends, public holidays and during school holidays, and $9 million to complete the new and exciting Predator Prey precinct at Melbourne Zoo. $13.5 million to complete the Portarlington Safe Harbour project, giving the pier a new life as a hub for boating, recreation and the local aquaculture industry. $50 million to continue planned burning on public land, which reduces bushfire risk, and $7 million to remove hazardous trees next to roads and tracks. A new mountain bike facility at Harcourt, and a 144 kilometre trail through the Grampians National Park, will also be funded to bring more tourists to our regions. Climate change is back on the agenda. Schools, businesses and farmers will get the support they need to become more sustainable.

The Budget includes: A $50 million Stronger Regional Communities plan, helping towns attract more families and young people to live and work in regional Victoria. $20 million to bring the arts to our regions, build partnerships with local councils, support regional galleries and performing arts centres and shine a spotlight on creative industries across Victoria. $80 million to bring more major events to our state and attract more interstate and international visitors to regional Victoria and Melbourne. $70 million to build a new grandstand at Geelong's Simonds Stadium, improving facilities and increasing the ground's capacity to 36,000 - a new life for Australia's proudest regional stadium. $11 million to upgrade dilapidated buildings, toilets, paths and roads and build new facilities in national and state parks across Victoria. $13.5 million to complete the Portarlington Safe Harbour project, giving the pier a new life as a hub for boating, recreation and the local aquaculture industry. $45 million to protect our rivers and waterways, improve the health of agricultural land and help farmers manage water use more efficiently. $20 million to bring the arts to regions $13.5 million to complete the Portarlington Safe Harbour project Australia's governments need to work together to face up to our challenges as a nation. But working together means working in good faith and paying your fair share. The Commonwealth Government's cuts to our schools, hospitals and other services that every struggling family relies on, are simply unfair. These cuts include $8.9 billion from our education system and more than $13 billion from our health system over the next 10 years. Nor is Victoria getting our fair share of funding for the projects our state needs. Victoria's average share of national infrastructure funding has only been around 20 per cent since 2001-02. The Andrews Labor Government is investing in job-creating projects of national significance, transforming our public transport system and reducing the costs of congestion on busy roads. Victoria will keep standing up for our fair share of infrastructure funding so we can get on with these projects faster. Victoria opposes the cuts to our schools, hospitals and other services, and we will fight for our share of education funding. The Andrews Labor Government is prepared to work with the Commonwealth to help our state grow, but we will never work for them. We put Victorians first."
