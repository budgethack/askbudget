We're building more projects and providing more services for families in growing areas, because they are the basic building blocks of our society, keeping families together and communities healthy. The Andrews Labor Government will rebuild and upgrade school buildings across the state and build new local schools and classrooms for kids in growing suburbs. Hospitals will be built and upgraded to reduce pressure on health services and emergency departments in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. We're getting on with the projects we need - transforming our public transport system and reducing congestion on busy local roads so people in the outer suburbs can get home safer and sooner. Interface Councils, serving and representing outer suburban areas, have identified the infrastructure projects their communities needed to sustain the growth of their local populations. The Budget provides $50 million as an initial contribution towards an Interface Councils Infrastructure Fund to help councils in growing outer suburban areas get proposed local projects off the ground."
