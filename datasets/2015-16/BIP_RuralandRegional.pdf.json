They are home to about one quarter of Victoria's population. Rural and regional Victoria generates around a quarter of the state's economic output. Key industries include health care and social assistance, retail trade, agriculture, forestry and fishing, manufacturing and construction. The Andrews Labor Government's investments will make regional Victoria more economically competitive and create new jobs. Regional Victoria can also seize new opportunities, such as new energy technology, food and fibre processing and tourism. For rural and regional Victoria to grow, the Labor Government will ensure that: \uf034 There is business confidence to invest in new jobs \uf034 Young people and workers can get the skills they need \uf034 Regional businesses have support to expand and innovate \uf034 Transport infrastructure connects regions to market places"
