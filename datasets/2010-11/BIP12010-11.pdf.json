                    "text": "COVERAGE The 2010-11 Public Sector Asset Investment Program - Budget Information Paper No. 1 (BIP1) is compiled in association with the annual budget papers to inform Parliament and the community about Victoria's asset investment program. The asset investment projects published in this paper support the outputs detailed in the 2010-11 Budget Paper No. 3, Service Delivery . BIP1 presents detailed listings of major public sector investments: \u2022 for the general government sector; \u2022 for the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sector; and \u2022 those projects being delivered under Partnerships Victoria . For the general government sector, BIP1 captures projects with a total estimated investment (TEI) equal to or in excess of $250 000. However for the PNFC sector, projects listed have a TEI equal to or in excess of $1 million and all remaining projects are captured in the 'Other' category. BIP1 does not include: \u2022 general government sector projects with a planned capital expenditure in 2010-11 of less than $75 000 and projects recorded specifically as capital grants paid to other sectors; and \u2022 PNFC projects that have planned capital expenditure in 2010-11 of less than $150 000 which, for the purposes of this publication, are considered complete. ASSETS The Victorian Government is supporting the State's recovery from the recent economic downturn by continuing to deliver a significant infrastructure program aimed at securing jobs and providing the services that are needed for a growing Victorian population. Asset investment projects result in the production, enhancement and acquisition of non-current physical assets, typically infrastructure assets. The State's asset portfolio includes road and railway networks, information technology systems, research facilities, schools, hospitals and social housing, as well as water storage and distribution infrastructure, correctional centres, courts, cultural assets such as historic museum collections, and environmental assets such as public reserves, parks and public open space. These infrastructure assets support the delivery of quality services or products for the Victorian community. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE The projects contained in this publication are listed together with their location under entity headings. Details of TEI are provided with projected asset investment expenditures on individual projects for 2010-11 and beyond. For each entity, the asset investments are listed as either: \u2022 'New' - projects approved by the Treasurer or the entity's board and announced as part of the 2009-10 Budget Update or the 2010-11 Budget ; or \u2022 'Existing' - projects that have previously received government approval and delivery will be in progress as at 30 June 2010. BIP1 is prepared by the Department of Treasury and Finance with input from across the general government and PNFC sectors. It should be noted that project details reflect the intentions and priorities as at 27 April 2010. However, asset investments are rarely static and it can be expected that some re-scheduling and re-programming will occur over the course of the year."

                    "text": "In 2009-10, the Victorian Government responded to the challenges posed by the global financial crisis with resilience, while maintaining the State's solid fiscal position. Through the 2009-10 Budget , the Victorian Government announced a significant number of new infrastructure projects, some in partnership with the Commonwealth Government. These projects have created and supported jobs, promoted private investment, and have provided the State with long-term economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits. In the 2010-11 Budget , the Government is continuing to invest in a significant asset program. This is supporting the recovery by securing jobs, as well as providing the infrastructure required to support strong population growth. Investment is provided through both the general government sector (e.g. government departments) and the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sector (e.g. urban and regional water authorities). The Government is delivering critical transport infrastructure as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, including the construction of the Regional Rail Link to increase capacity for both regional and suburban trains. It is also undertaking a number of important hospital developments, including the construction of the Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre to assist the advancement of cancer treatments as well as to improve patient care as part of the Government's Cancer Action Plan. The Victorian Government continues to fund the modernisation and regeneration of Victorian Government school facilities through its Victorian Schools Plan and, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Government, through the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan's Building the Education Revolution program. This is in addition to State-funded projects for housing and securing future water supplies. The Government's asset investment program also reflects the Government's support of regional areas. Chart 1.1 shows the distribution across the State of asset investment projects that have been included in 2010-11 Budget Information Paper No. 1 (BIP1), with 44 per cent of total projects being delivered in regional Victoria and a further 23 per cent supporting service delivery across the entire State. Chart 1.1: Distribution of the 2010-11 BIP1 asset investment projects by area - percentage of total of number of BIP1 asset investment projects Statewide 23% Regional Victoria 44% Metropolitan Melbourne 33% KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS The Government is committed to delivering significant levels of infrastructure to support the long-term economic growth of Victoria. Table 1.1 provides a consolidated report on key infrastructure projects being delivered across the State. The key projects identified each have a total estimated investment (TEI) greater than $100 million. These projects support current government outcomes and are listed according to four of the five components of the Government's Growing Victoria Together vision, which are: \u2022 Thriving economy : to support the long term growth of the economy, encourage innovative industry and private investment, and to generate jobs; \u2022 Quality health and education: to provide high quality, accessible health and community services, as well as education and training for all ages; \u2022 Healthy environment: to ensure the efficient use of natural resources and protect the environment for future generations; and \u2022 Caring communities: to build safe and friendly communities that respect diversity and reduce disadvantage. Also included in Table 1.1 are key infrastructure projects delivered as Partnerships Victoria projects.

(b) Expenditure for the year to 30 June 2010 based on information provided by departments and agencies as at 27 April 2010. (c) This project is funded in partnership with the Commonwealth Government through the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan (formerly AusLink). The TEI represents the investment to the project over the program's six-year partnered funding agreement. (d) The Government is investing $218 million in this project, with the rest of the project funding required being sourced from TCV borrowing, the Melbourne Market Authority's (the market operator) surplus fund and proceeds from sale of surplus land. TCV borrowing is expected to be fully serviced and repaid through the rent revenue generated at the new market when it is operational. (e) The TEI of $1 490 million includes $1 175 million for 38 new metropolitan trains and $315 million for 50 regional train carriages. Notes (continued): (f) Regional Rail Link is jointly funded by the State and Commonwealth governments with contributions of $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion respectively. Preliminary project cashflows are identified and final cashflows are to be confirmed following further design work. (g) The total Revitalising Central Dandenong project is valued at $290 million. The State is contributing asset funding of $243.45 million with additional funding to be provided through developer contributions. This project is now being reported under VicUrban in Chapter 3. (h) This project is a combination of three separate initiatives: Western Highway Duplication - Ballarat to Stawell, Western Highway Realignment - Anthony's Cutting (Melton to Bacchus Marsh) and Western Highway Upgrade - Stawell to South Australian Border. (i) This project is made up of two separate programs as part of the Commonwealth's Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan : Primary Schools for the 21 st Century and Science and Language Centres. Figures are estimates as at 27 April 2010 and incorporate changes to funding announced by the Commonwealth on 27 August 2009. The Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan also provides operating funding for the National Schools Pride Program. (j) This a joint initiative between the Commonwealth and the State governments. The initiative includes funding of $219 million from non-government sources and a $426.1 million contribution from each of the State and Commonwealth Governments. (k) This project includes $21 million of operating funding for Increased Access to Computers and funding delivered through Partnerships Victoria . This project includes the Partnerships Victoria in Schools Project. (l) The TEI for this project was reported in the 2009-10 Budget Information Paper No. 1 as $322 million. Since this time, the TEI has been revised to $380 million. (m) This project is being delivered by Melbourne Water (TEI $422 million) and Yarra Valley Water (TEI $228 million). (n) This project was formerly known as the Food Bowl Modernisation project. This project also includes a $100 million contribution from Goulburn-Murray Water and output expenditure of $329.7 million, bringing the total project cost to $1 004 million. Output expenditure includes the connections program to deliver on-farm work. (o) This project includes Ararat Prison, which is being delivered as part of Partnerships Victoria . (p) The funding for this initiative reflects the Commonwealth Government's revised Social Housing Commitment made under its Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan . A portion of this housing will be delivered by the not-for-profit sector. (q) The values given for Partnerships Victoria projects are the finance lease liabilities that will be recognised in future years for these projects, as set out in Budget Paper No. 2 , Chapter 3, Table 3.4: Application of cash resources. These values include construction costs as well as certain financing and other costs incurred by the private sector contractor to deliver the project, but exclude the State's delivery costs, and finance, operating and maintenance costs over the operating phase of the project contract. (r) The delivery cost of the project consisting of Southern Way's construction costs and Linking Melbourne Authority's delivery costs is $759 million (nominal). (s) The capital cost for this project is $3.5 billion. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS Below is a list of descriptions for the key strategic infrastructure projects identified in Table 1.1, which are listed as they appear in the table under the Growing Victoria Together themes. Thriving economy Geelong Ring Road - stages 4A and 4B Geelong Ring Road Stage 4A will extend over the existing Princes Highway West and along Anglesea Road, terminating near Hams Road. Stage 4B will provide a new five kilometre link from Anglesea Road south of Hams Road to the Princes Highway. These projects will improve safety to motorists through improved travel conditions and will deliver substantial benefits and savings to industry in both Melbourne and the Geelong region. This initiative will also continue to contribute to growing and linking Victoria by enhancing the performance of road networks improving travel time and safety. Goulburn Valley Nagambie Bypass This project constructs a freeway standard bypass of Nagambie to the east of the township, and duplication of the existing highway to the north. The bypass will improve freight connections to the Goulburn Valley region, efficiency and reliability of travel, and safety for road users and local residents in the region. Improving train operations - rail service efficiencies This program is to continuously improve the reliability and capacity of rail services across Melbourne, including the upgrading of train and tram control and monitoring systems. M80 upgrade The upgrade of the Western Ring Road, in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, will increase traffic capacity, improve safety, ease congestion and improve travel times along one of Melbourne's key transport corridors. Improvements will include additional traffic lanes, reconfigured interchanges and ramps, and implementation of other traffic management initiatives. This will improve driving conditions for all freeway users including the road freight industry, while catering for future traffic demand. Melbourne Wholesale Markets redevelopment The new Melbourne Wholesale Market at Epping will replace the existing Footscray Road infrastructure which is reaching the end of its design life. The new market provides opportunities for Victoria's fruit, vegetable and flower production, distribution and retail industry to become more efficient. The project will also make the current site available for the implementation of Port Futures , the Government's strategy for the State's ports. Metropolitan train safety communications system Upgrading the existing metropolitan rail management systems with state of the art technology will allow for better coordination of the movement of trains on the network, increase the number of trains that can safely run on the system and provide more reliable up to the minute timetable information for passengers. myki Train, tram and bus travel will become simpler for passengers throughout Victoria with the progressive rollout of a smartcard ticketing system. New stations in growth areas This initiative provides funding to construct and operate new stations at Williams Landing, Lynbrook, Caroline Springs and Cardinia Road. Princes Highway West - Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea This project involves widening and construction to upgrade the Princes Highway as an 'M' standard four-lane divided road between Waurn Ponds and Winchelsea to improve safety, deliver more efficient freight movements, and improve access and better connect communities and services. Princes Highway (west) is a key route through south-western Victoria providing a strategic link from Geelong to the South Australian border and beyond to Adelaide. Purchase of additional rolling stock (suburban and VLocity) Purchase of additional train rolling stock and VLocity passenger trains will improve rail load carrying capacity and passenger comfort. VLocity trains run faster than older stock (up to 160km per hour instead of 100km per hour) and therefore will reduce congestion and travel time on regional rail lines by increasing capacity in the Regional Fast Rail corridors. An investment in new X'trapolis trains for the metropolitan network will meet demand for public transport and address patronage growth. Regional Rail Link The project will construct a dual track link of up to 50 kilometres from West Werribee to central Melbourne's Southern Cross Station, via Sunshine. This includes construction of a new rail line from Werribee to Deer Park, new stations at Tarneit and Wyndham Vale, and duplication of existing tracks between Sunshine and Kensington. The project will deliver capacity for an extra 9 000 regional and suburban passengers every hour and will allow regional rail services to run express into Melbourne, increasing transport capacity and reliability for Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. Revitalising Central Dandenong This project includes various improvements to position Central Dandenong as an economic hub. Improvements include the development of a metropolitan village on the old saleyards site, development of the Lonsdale Street boulevard and the development of the George Street Bridge. This project will facilitate private sector investment leading to more jobs and economic growth for the region. South Morang rail extension This initiative will extend the metropolitan rail network by three and a half kilometres from Epping to South Morang, including the construction of a new premium station at South Morang, and three grade separations. In addition, this initiative will duplicate five kilometres of track between Keon Park and Epping to provide sufficient capacity for the new South Morang services. Sunbury electrification This initiative will extend the metropolitan train network by 15 kilometres through the electrification of the track between Watergardens and Sunbury. This will allow V/Line trains to be substituted with higher capacity metropolitan trains and enable approximately 1 800 more people each hour to commute along the Sunbury rail corridor. Tram procurement and supporting infrastructure This initiative will enable the purchase and operation of 50 new high capacity, low-floor trams and the supporting infrastructure, which includes the redevelopment of the Preston tram workshops into a tram depot and a power supply upgrade. Western Highway upgrades Three projects along the Western Highway are being delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth Government. The Western Highway duplication project involves the construction of a four lane, two carriageway highway along the existing Western Highway from Ballarat to Stawell, approximately 110 kilometres in length. This project will help deliver more efficient freight movements between manufacturers in regional areas. It will also improve safety conditions for all road users, provide better access to local facilities, and reduce traffic volumes on regional roads. A new five kilometre freeway alignment will avoid the steep hills and tight curves at Anthony's Cutting, improving safety and reducing travel times between Melton and Bacchus Marsh. The project will allow motorists to travel safely at higher speeds and assist freight movements between Melbourne, western Victoria and South Australia. Additional overtaking lanes and rest areas on the Western Highway between Stawell and the South Australian border will help deliver improved efficiency of freight movements between Melbourne, western Victoria and South Australia. It will also improve safety for all road users. West Gate-Monash Freeways improvement project and West Gate Bridge strengthening This project represents a major upgrade of the Monash, City Link and West Gate Freeways (Southern Link section) to improve traffic flow along the 75 kilometre west-east corridor that carries essential freight and thousands of commuters daily. These improvements tackle congestion and improve travel times for motorists and Victoria's road freight industry. This project also ensures the long term sustainability of the West Gate Bridge and safety for commuters. Quality health and education Box Hill Hospital redevelopment The $407.5 million investment to redevelop Box Hill Hospital is the single largest suburban health infrastructure project in Victoria and will allow 7 000 additional patients to be treated each year. The new emergency and surgery block will include a new larger emergency department with 19 extra cubicles, a new intensive care unit, additional in-patients wards, six new operating theatres and four refurbished operating theatres. The redevelopment will double the size of the facility and transform Box Hill Hospital into a modern, innovative and technologically advanced hospital. The Government has already spent more than $46 million for a new renal dialysis service, new office and research space, essential infrastructure works and a 600 space car park. Building the Education Revolution This project forms part of the Commonwealth Government's Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan . It recognises that high quality school infrastructure is critical to delivering excellent educational outcomes and demonstrates the commitment of the Commonwealth and State governments to ensuring immediate construction activity to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The project will enable the building of major new infrastructure for government primary and special schools. Buildings will include new facilities such as libraries, multipurpose halls and classrooms or the upgrade of existing facilities. Funding has been provided for science and language centres to those Victorian Government secondary schools that have the greatest need. New Bendigo Hospital The new Bendigo Hospital will deliver sustainable health services into the future. It will be the largest regional hospital project ever undertaken in Victoria, and will improve access to services and expand physical capacity to meet current and future demand. The project will deliver 308 new acute in-patient beds, an emergency department with 34 cubicles, eight operating theatres, 75 new mental health beds, an integrated women's and children's facility including six birthing suites and six consulting rooms, and an additional radiotherapy bunker and linear accelerator. There will also be expanded ambulatory service capability including renal, cancer and outpatient services. Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre The Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre will be a world class centre, purpose designed to facilitate best practice cancer care and the sharing of ideas and knowledge by the best minds in cancer research and clinical care. This will translate into the latest treatments, improved access to clinical trials, and the education and upskilling of Victoria's cancer workforce. Trade training centres - government schools This project forms part of the Commonwealth Government's Trade Training Centres in Schools program. The trade training centres will help to increase the proportion of students achieving Year 12 or an equivalent qualification and address skill shortages in traditional trades and emerging industries. Victorian Schools Plan - schools and school-ICT projects The Victorian Schools Plan is the Government's 10 year plan to transform Victorian schools by funding the rebuilding, renovating or extending of all government schools by 2016-17 and to deliver projects such as the Ultranet , which is a statewide online teaching and learning system. Healthy environment Eastern Treatment Plant - tertiary upgrade This project is an upgrade to treat wastewater to tertiary standard, which will deliver a broad range of treated water quality benefits for both the receiving marine environment and non-potable recycling applications by 2012. Melbourne main sewer replacement The Melbourne main sewer replacement comprises the construction of a 2.2 kilometre gravity sewer from the interface with City West Water's assets north of the Yarra River to the Hobsons Bay main sewer. This will prevent the risk of structural failure and sewer collapse, and reduce environmental and public health risks. It will also cater for forecast growth in sewage flows in the catchment, and allow the continued provision of sewerage services to Melbourne Docklands, the central business district, and parts of Port Melbourne and South Melbourne. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2012. Northern sewerage project This project involves the construction of a 12.4 kilometre sewer that will connect the sewerage system near the Merri Creek at Coburg and the Moonee Ponds Creek in Pascoe Vale to Melbourne Water's North Western Sewer in Essendon. The project is intended to provide relief for the existing overloaded sewerage system, and ensure compliance with the State Environment Protection Policy. The project will protect the environment by preventing sewage spills into Edgars, Darebin, Merri and Moonee Ponds creeks. In line with the Government's Melbourne 2030 Strategy , the project has been sized to provide capacity for the growth in the various catchments to the north and to provide sewer servicing for the key development corridors of Craigieburn, Epping and South Morang. Works are progressing well and are on target to be complete in 2012. Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project The Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project is designed to save 225 billion litres on average a year of water in the Goulburn and Murray irrigation systems currently lost through leaks, evaporation and other inefficiencies. The water saved will be shared equally by irrigators, the environment and (up to 75 billion litres) to Melbourne. The project is due for completion in 2012-13. The project represents a once in a generation opportunity to adapt and modernise the irrigation economy of Northern Victoria to meet the challenges of drought and climate change. Caring communities Building confidence in corrections Enhancements to the corrections system funded in the 2008-09 Budget included the construction of a new 350 bed male prison at Ararat and expansion of capacity at various existing prison sites. This expanded capacity helps meet projected future demand in the corrections system. In addition, asset funding will improve the management of high risk sex offenders who are subject to the new post sentence supervision and detention scheme. The new facility, scheduled to begin construction in mid-2010, will be built with a focus on providing an environment conducive to rehabilitation and reducing recidivism, in line with the Growing Victoria Together vision to build friendly, confident and safe communities. In 2009-10, funding was approved for an additional 100 temporary beds across the prison system. These beds will provide additional capacity in the prison system prior to, and following, the opening of the new prison at Ararat. Funds were also committed to refurbish existing double bunks and temporary accommodation in the prison system to extend their life. Melbourne and Olympic Park redevelopment - stage 1 Stage 1 of the redevelopment of Melbourne and Olympic Park will cater for the growing popularity of the Australian Open and establish Melbourne and Olympic Park as a leading sports and events precinct. There will be a strong emphasis on the comfort of patrons, with more open space and shade, increased seating capacity, better connections to public transport and the city, and easier movement into and within Melbourne and Olympic Parks. The $363 million first stage of the redevelopment includes a major upgrade to fully enclose Margaret Court Arena, including the installation of a retractable roof, the construction of a new Eastern Plaza, incorporating eight new indoor courts and 13 outdoor courts for elite training and general public use, and upgrades to Rod Laver Arena and other venues. Social housing The Commonwealth Government has committed $1.167 billion for the provision of social housing as part of the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan . Funding enables the construction of around 4 500 social housing dwellings, which will provide more disadvantaged households and homeless people access to safe and secure housing. This includes the delivery of more than 600 social housing dwellings which have been made possible due to Victoria being able to deliver high quality social housing, at a unit cost considerably lower than the Commonwealth Government's benchmark of $300 000. In addition, the Commonwealth Government is providing $99 million to refurbish existing social housing stock to increase the useable life of properties and improve the amenity for tenants. This will enable the retention of at least 1 600 social housing properties that will otherwise become unsuitable for occupancy. Southbank Cultural Precinct redevelopment Redevelopment of Hamer Hall and its surrounds will maintain Melbourne's position as an arts hub, attracting international and interstate visitors and contributing to the identity and liveability of the city. Refurbishments will include enhanced acoustics, staging systems, new auditorium seating, expanded foyer spaces and riverside improvements. Key infrastructure projects delivered by Partnerships Victoria Peninsula Link Peninsula Link will be a 27 kilometre freeway standard road from EastLink and the Frankston Freeway at Carrum Downs to the Mornington Peninsula Freeway at Mount Martha. It will reduce congestion in the Frankston area, slashing travel times for a full trip to just 17 minutes while reducing traffic congestion in Frankston city and other Peninsula towns, making these areas more attractive to tourists, pedestrians and cyclists and allowing development of Frankston as a Central Activities District. The project includes on and off ramp connections to 11 roads including three freeway to freeway connections, more than 35 bridges and a 22 kilometre walking and cycling path alongside the freeway. Peninsula Link will open in early 2013 and is being delivered by the Southern Way consortium, which was appointed to design, finance, construct, operate and maintain the freeway and related infrastructure in accordance with the Partnerships Victoria framework. The new Royal Children's Hospital This project will replace the existing Royal Children's Hospital with a new state of the art 340 bed children's hospital. The new energy efficient hospital will be completed in 2011 and will provide improved, world class health facilities for Victorian children and their families. The net present cost of the project is approximately 7 per cent below the public sector comparator, which is a key indicator that the project delivers value for money for the State. The winning bidder's proposal also offers other significant benefits, such as enhanced amenity, additional space within the building, and world class design. Victorian Desalination Plant This project will see the construction of a seawater desalination plant at Wonthaggi and associated infrastructure, including an 84 kilometre pipeline to connect the plant to Melbourne's water supply system. The plant will have capacity to provide an additional 150 billion litres of water a year to Melbourne, Geelong, Westernport and South Gippsland. The project is scheduled to commence delivery of water by December 2011. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY The Victorian Government manages an extensive range of public physical assets. The State's asset portfolio includes assets such as schools, hospitals, courts and prisons in the general government sector, and water storage and distribution infrastructure, public housing, port infrastructure and public transportation systems in the PNFC sector. Details of the value of the total non-financial assets in the general government sector are published in the 2010-11 Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes . The value of total non-financial assets in the PNFC sector is published in the 2010-11 Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 2 Supplementary Uniform Presentation Framework Tables . Asset investment decisions are guided by government policy relating to the management of environmental and financial resources. The Government's vision is articulated in key strategic planning documents including Growing Victoria Together , the Victorian Transport Plan, Melbourne@5 million , and Moving Forward in Provincial Victoria . Asset investment decisions are further informed by a range of forums including: existing legislation, demand drivers, service standards, community consultation, advice from departments on service delivery needs, policy and contractual commitments, and whole of life asset plans. The Government has established several planning and governance processes to support the planning and delivery of public sector assets. These include: \u2022 the Asset Management Framework: the set of explicit processes and products utilised by general government that together address the asset management responsibilities of the State. Introduced in 2005, it applies a combination of management, financial, economic, engineering, planning and other practices to assets, with the objective of producing the required level of service in the most effective manner; \u2022 the Gateway Initiative : a general government-wide project introduced in 2003, to improve investment selection, management and delivery for the State through the implementation of robust processes relating to project planning, business case development, project delivery and reporting; and \u2022 Partnerships Victoria : a framework introduced in 2000 that provides a whole of government approach to the provision of infrastructure and related ancillary services through public-private partnerships. It focuses on whole of life costing and full consideration of project risks and optimal risk allocation between the public and private sectors. It is most useful for major and complex capital projects with opportunities for innovation and risk transfer. Investment in renewal and replacement of assets sustains the capital stock to directly support service delivery. Asset investment program BIP1 details the Government's asset investment program from the perspective of individual projects. The subsequent chapters of BIP1 provide listings of projects that meet specific criteria (as outlined in the Introduction), with details on the TEI provided for each project together with expenditure to date, estimated expenditure for the current financial year and any remaining future year expenditure. The TEI of the asset investment program included in this publication is $35.9 billion, with $16.7 billion worth of projects in the general government sector and the remaining $19.2 billion provided through the PNFC sector entities listed in Chapter 3. Assets investments summarised in Table 1.2 use the same categorisation of projects for those in Chapters 2 and 3.

Sources of funding Asset investment can require significant and long-term funding commitments given the scale of the projects. Asset investment in both the general government and PNFC sectors is funded from a combination of sources including: \u2022 operating cash flows; \u2022 borrowings; \u2022 revenue from asset sales; and/or \u2022 State and Commonwealth Government funding. The TEI for the individual projects reported in BIP1 reflects the total value of all of these sources of funding. Partnerships Victoria A number of asset investment projects are also procured through Partnerships Victoria arrangements. The choice between public and private provisions of infrastructure and associated services is based on an assessment of value for money and public interest considerations. This framework ensures that investment decisions are based on merit and outcomes are judged on the public benefits obtained. The existing Partnerships Victoria projects, including those under construction, represent a total estimated capital expenditure of approximately $10.25 billion, of which the following have been commissioned and are operational: \u2022 County Court; \u2022 Wodonga Wastewater Treatment Plant; \u2022 Campaspe Waste Reclamation Scheme; \u2022 Casey Community Hospital; \u2022 Mobile Data Network; \u2022 Victorian Correctional Facilities; \u2022 Southern Cross Station redevelopment; \u2022 Emergency Alerting System; \u2022 Royal Melbourne Showgrounds redevelopment; \u2022 Metropolitan Mobile Radio; \u2022 the new Royal Women's Hospital; \u2022 Ballarat North Water Reclamation project; \u2022 EastLink; and \u2022 Melbourne Convention Centre development. A further five contracted projects are in the construction phase. These projects are: \u2022 Barwon Water bio-solids management project; \u2022 the new Royal Children's Hospital project; \u2022 Partnerships Victoria in Schools project (five of 11 schools have been completed to date); \u2022 Victorian Desalination Plant; and \u2022 Peninsula Link. In addition, the procurement process is underway for the following projects: \u2022 Ararat Prison project; and \u2022 Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre.

(b) In addition to the projects identified in Chapter 3, there are redevelopment, improvement and acquisition projects that may be funded in part or full by the Nation Building and Jobs Plan National Partnership and accordingly have not been included in the Office of Housing figures. This data should be read in conjunction with the Social Housing data included in Table 1.1. For all projects valued over a set threshold, PNFC entities are required to submit a detailed business case of the proposal to the Department of Treasury and Finance. These are reviewed and evaluated by the Department before the Treasurer's approval is obtained. The threshold is set for a particular entity in accordance with a three tier approach, being $10 million, $20 million or $50 million, depending on the relative size and risk of the PNFC entity. The three thresholds have been developed to ensure that the business case review and acceptance process focuses on those projects that are of a complex, high value and high risk nature. The assessment of the appropriate threshold for an individual PNFC is based on size and risk of each entity. The growth in capital stock for the sector, excluding revaluation movements, has largely been funded through operating cash flows, borrowings, revenue from asset sales and State and Commonwealth Government funding and grants. Contributions from the private sector (for example from developers providing assets, free of charge to entities in the water sector) also add to the asset base of the sector. The Government has announced significant infrastructure investments for the PNFC sector. Descriptions of these asset investments are presented in Budget Paper No. 2, Chapter 4 Fiscal Sustainability of the State ."
