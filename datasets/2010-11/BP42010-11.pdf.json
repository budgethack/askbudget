This information includes details on sources of funding, and how the departments are funding their service delivery. This budget paper takes into account the financial impacts of all policy decisions taken by the Victorian Government, as well as Commonwealth Government funding revisions and other information that affects the projected general government sector Estimated Financial Statements as at 28 April 2010 unless otherwise stated. Budget Paper No. 4 consists of the following chapters and appendices: Chapter 1 - Estimated Financial Statements and notes This chapter presents the Estimated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the Victorian general government sector for the period 2010-11 to 2013-14. The statements are presented in a format consistent with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting , issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) in October 2007 and applicable to annual reporting periods commencing 1 July 2008. The statements also comply with the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) as it relates to the general government sector, with the UPF adopting AASB 1049 as the presentation framework across jurisdictions from 2008 onwards. The Estimated Financial Statements are consistent with the Financial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement (see Budget Paper No. 2, Chapter 1 Economic and Fiscal Strategies and Objectives ) in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Management Act 1994 . Additional disclosures in relation to the UPF are included in Chapter 2, along with a compliance index of all UPF tables. The Victorian Auditor-General has reviewed the Estimated Financial Statements for the Victorian general government sector. The Auditor-General's Review Statement is presented at the beginning of Chapter 1. Chapter 2 - Supplementary uniform presentation framework tables Chapter 2 forms part of the UPF along with Chapter 1, and provides additional information of sectoral financial statements for the public non-financial corporations sector and for the non-financial public sector. These financial statements are also presented in a format consistent with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting , which has been adopted as the presentation framework under the UPF. In addition, the chapter includes the Loan Council Allocation estimates (the government's net call on financial markets in a given financial year to meet its budget obligations), and details of Victoria's infrastructure projects with private sector investment where contracts are expected to be signed in 2010-11. Chapter 3 - Departmental financial statements Chapter 3 contains departmental financial estimates that detail information on departmental resources, as well as the authority for resources for each department. The departmental Estimated Financial Statements are presented on a consolidated basis for all general government reporting entities within each departmental portfolio. They form the basis of the consolidated Estimated Financial Statements for the Victorian general government sector provided in Chapter 1. Chapter 4 - State revenue Chapter 4 outlines the major sources of state revenue, both state-sourced revenue, (including taxes, fines and regulatory fees, dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue), and revenue provided through Commonwealth grants, for both general and specific purposes. The estimates of Commonwealth Government grants represent the latest information available to the Victorian Government at the time of finalisation of Victoria's 2010-11 Budget . Chapter 5 - Tax expenditures and concessions Chapter 5 provides an overview and forward estimates of tax expenditures as required by Section 23K of the Financial Management Act 1994 . This chapter also outlines the estimated cost of Victorian Government concessions. Chapter 6 - Public account Chapter 6 discloses information on the Public Account, which includes estimated transactions and the year-end balances of the Consolidated Fund and the Trust Fund. Details of estimated Consolidated Fund receipts, payments, special appropriations and annual departmental appropriations are also provided. Information relating to Trust Fund activities includes estimated cash flows and projected year-end balances. Chapter 7 - Contingent assets and contingent liabilities Chapter 7 discloses information on the State's contingent assets and liabilities. It provides an overview of assets and liabilities that could arise from past events or future risks, and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the general government sector. This chapter discloses both quantifiable and non-quantifiable contingent assets and liabilities. Appendix A - Historical and forward estimates tables The historical and forward estimates tables in Appendix A show the trend in general government sector aggregate cash flows over the period 1986-87 to 2013-14 and the general government net results for the period 1996-97 to 2013-14. The remaining tables show information for the general government sector classified by government purpose. The accruals expenditure series classified by purpose is presented for the period 1961-62 to 2013-14. Appendix B - Quarterly Financial Report for the Victorian General Government Sector Appendix B presents the quarterly financial report for the Victorian general government sector, incorporating the actual outcomes for the nine month period ended 31 March 2010, and quarter by quarter results. The March year to date outcomes are compared with the full year revised 2009-10 Budget . Appendix C - Revised 2009-10 Budget Outcome The revised 2009-10 Budget outcome is presented in Appendix C. The revised 2009-10 estimates take into account government policy decisions and economic developments affecting both revenue and expenses since the presentation of the 2009-10 Budget to Parliament in May 2009."

                    "text": "The following Estimated Financial Statements and accompanying explanatory notes set out the forecast financial results for the Victorian general government sector for the period 2010-11 to 2013-14. The prospective nature of these statements reflects a number of judgements about the most likely operating and financial conditions for the Victorian general government sector. Variations in these assumed conditions, such as international developments and other risks to the national economy, from which Victoria would not be immune, may cause the Victorian general government sector actual result to differ from the projections. In particular, the actual outcome resulting from the recently announced changes to health funding may differ from the estimates included in these Estimated Financial Statements, as details are yet to be finalised. The Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Management Act 1994 . This Act requires the Estimated Financial Statements to be consistent with the financial policy objectives and strategies statement (see Budget Paper No. 2, Chapter 1 Economic and Fiscal Strategies and Objectives ), in a manner and form determined by the Minister, having regard to appropriate financial reporting frameworks. The statements, including the Victorian general government sector's investment in other sectors, have been prepared in accordance with applicable Australian Accounting Standards, including Interpretations. As there is no specific Australian accounting standard or other authoritative pronouncement that prescribes the preparation and presentation of prospective financial statements, the Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared having regard to the principles set out in the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements (FRS-42). The statements are presented in a format that complies with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting . This standard also complies with the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) as it relates to the general government sector. Additional disclosures in relation to the UPF are included in Chapter 2 Supplementary Uniform Presentation Framework Tables , along with a compliance index of all UPF tables. Due to the possibility that circumstances or events outlined in the Estimated Financial Statements may not occur as expected, actual results may differ from those forecast and the difference may be substantial. Accordingly, no guarantee is given that the financial results will be achieved. However, appropriate professional judgement has been applied in preparing the Estimated Financial Statements. The accompanying notes to the financial statements provide details of the major economic and other assumptions used, and the specific forecast assumptions underlying major items in the financial statements. A number of these assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties, which are outside the control of the Government. The Victorian Auditor-General has reviewed the Estimated Financial Statements and his review report follows. Auditor General's Report INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT Estimated Financial Statements To the Members of the Parliament of Victoria The Estimated Financial Statements The accompanying estimated financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2011 and the three forward years ended 30 June 2012, 2013 and 2014 of the Victorian General Government Sector, as defined in note 26 to the statements, which comprises the estimated operating statement, estimated balance sheet, estimated cash flow statement, estimated statement of changes in equity, a statement of significant accounting policies and forecast assumptions and other explanatory notes to and forming part of the estimated financial statements, and the supporting declaration, has been reviewed. The accompanying revised 2010 estimated balance sheet has also been reviewed. The remaining parts of the Budget Papers have not been subject to my review. Treasurer's Responsibility for the Estimated Financial Statements The Treasurer of Victoria, through the Secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance, is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the estimated financial statements in accordance with sections 23H-23K of the Financial Management Act 1994. Auditor's Responsibility My review of the estimated financial statements has been conducted under section 16B of the Audit Act 1994 which requires me to state whether anything has come to my attention that would cause me to not believe that the statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies on which they are stated to be based, are consistent with the target established for the key financial measure specified in the accompanying notes to the statements, have been properly prepared on the basis of the economic assumptions stated in the accompanying notes to the statements, and the methodologies used to determine those assumptions are reasonable. The review has been conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards applicable to the review of financial reports and prospective financial information, and has been limited primarily to inquiries of relevant personnel and assessments of the reasonableness of the key methodologies and processes followed to determine the assumptions and data upon which the estimated financial statements are based, and appropriate analytical procedures. These procedures do not provide all the evidence that would be required in an audit, thus the level of assurance provided is less than that which would be given in an audit. Accordingly, an audit has not been performed and an audit opinion is not expressed. Prospective financial information relates to events and actions that have not yet occurred and may not occur. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions and underlying data upon which prospective financial information is based, such evidence is generally future oriented and therefore less certain in nature. As a result, I am not in a position to obtain the level of assurance necessary to express a positive opinion on those assumptions and the accompanying forecast information included in the estimated financial statements. Accordingly, an opinion is not expressed on whether the forecasts will be achieved. The estimated financial statements of the Victorian General Government Sector have been prepared for inclusion in the Budget Papers which are presented to the Parliament. I disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report or on the estimated financial statements to which this report relates, to any person other than the Members of the Parliament of Victoria, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.

The Secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance is responsible for the integrity of the web site. I have not been engaged to report on the integrity of the web site. The review report refers only to the statements named above. A review report is not provided on any other information which may have been hyperlinked to or from these estimated financial statements. If users of this report are concerned with the inherent risks arising from electronic data communications, they are advised to refer to the hard copy of the reviewed estimated financial statements to confirm the information included in the estimated financial statements presented on this web site. Independence The Auditor-General's independence is established by the Constitution Act 1975 . The Auditor-General is not subject to direction by any person about the way in which his powers and responsibilities are to be exercised. In conducting the review, the Auditor-General, his staff and delegates complied with all applicable independence requirements of the Australian accounting profession. Review Statement Based on my review, which is not an audit, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to not believe that: \u2022 the estimated financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies on which they are stated to be based; \u2022 the estimated financial statements are consistent with the target established for the key financial measure specified in the accompanying notes to the statements; \u2022 the estimated financial statements have been properly prepared on the basis of the economic assumptions stated in the accompanying notes to the statements; and \u2022 the methodologies used to determine those assumptions are reasonable. Actual results achieved by the Victorian General Government Sector are likely to be different from those forecast in the estimated financial statements since anticipated results frequently do not occur as expected and the variation may be material. Accordingly, I express no opinion as to whether the forecasts will be achieved. MELBOURNE D.D.R.

Given the prospective nature of the Estimated Financial Statements, it has been necessary to apply the best professional judgement in preparing the Estimated Financial Statements. In my opinion, the Estimated Financial Statements have been properly prepared consistent with the requirements of sections 23H-23K of the Financial Management Act 1994 and take into account government decisions and other circumstances that have a material effect.

To gain a better understanding of the terminology and key aggregates used in this report, a glossary of terms can be found in Note 26 to these Estimated Financial Statements. (A) Assumptions The Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared using the material economic and other assumptions listed below. Material economic and other assumptions (a) (per cent change) 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 Real gross state product Employment Unemployment rate (b) Consumer price index Wage price index (c) Population (d) 3.25 2.00 5.50 2.25 3.25 1.90 3.00 1.75 5.25 2.50 3.50 1.80 3.00 1.75 5.25 2.50 3.50 1.70 3.00 1.75 5.25 2.50 3.50 1.70 Sources: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Department of Treasury and Finance Notes: (a) Year average per cent change on previous year unless otherwise indicated. All projections apart from population are rounded to the nearest 0.25 percentage point. Projections of population are rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point. (b) Year-average level, per cent. (c) Total hourly rate excluding bonuses. (d) June quarter, per cent change on previous June quarter. (B) Key financial measure The government has set out its key financial measure in the Financial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement as detailed in Budget Paper No. 2, Chapter 1. The key financial measure of a substantial net result from transactions is expected to be achieved throughout the forecast period. Fiscal target Key financial measure Maintain a substantial net result from transactions for the budget sector Target At least $100 million in each year (C) Sensitivity analysis The estimates for revenue, expenses, the net result from transactions, and the net result have been subject to analysis of assumed movements for a range of major economic and other risks by the Department of Treasury and Finance. As detailed in Budget Paper No. 2 Appendix B , analysis by the Department of Treasury and Finance shows that if there was, in the first year, 2010-11, a one percentage point rise in each of the following key economic variables above the forecast growth rate, the budgeted and estimated net result from transactions and net result over the forward estimates period would change as described in the following tables. It should be noted that the impact on the net result is inclusive of the impact on the net result from transactions.

(b) Assumes a one percentage point increase across the entire term structure, i.e. short and long rates, over the forward estimates period. (D) Statement of compliance The Estimated Financial Statements for the 2010-11 budget year, and the subsequent forecast years, have been prepared as required by Section 23H-23K of the Financial Management Act 1994 . The Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Australian Accounting Standards, including interpretations (AASs). In particular, they are presented in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting . However, the prospective nature of the Estimated Financial Statements means that some AAS disclosures are neither relevant nor practical and so these have been omitted. Because AASs do not include pronouncements that prescribe the preparation and presentation of prospective financial statements, the Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared having regard to the principles set out in New Zealand Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements (FRS-42). The Estimated Financial Statements for the 2010-11 budget year have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies expected to be used in preparing historically oriented general purpose financial statements for that year, and the same accounting policies have been used for the subsequent forecast years. The Government Financial Statistics (GFS) information included in this report is based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) GFS manual. The consolidated Victorian general government sector has, where applicable, applied those AAS paragraphs applicable to not-for-profit entities. The information presented in the Estimated Financial Statements takes into account all policy decisions taken by the Victorian Government, as well as Commonwealth Government funding revisions and circumstances that may have a material effect on the statements as at 28 April 2010. (E) Basis of accounting, preparation and measurement The accrual basis of accounting has been applied in the preparation of the Estimated Financial Statements whereby assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are recognised in the reporting period to which they relate, regardless of when cash is received or paid. These Estimated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars which is also the functional currency of the Victorian general government sector. In the application of AASs, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The currently expected financial impact of the recently announced health agreement between the Commonwealth and the State taken at the Council of Australian Government's meeting on 20 April 2010 is included in these financial statements. However the final legislated form of the health agreement may differ from current expectations, and so the timing and amount of revenues and expenditures may differ from estimates included in these financial statements. This report has been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. Historical cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. Exceptions to the historical cost convention include: \u2022 investments in other sector entities measured at net asset value; \u2022 non-current physical assets which, subsequent to acquisition, are measured at a revalued amount being their fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses. Revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amounts do not materially differ from their fair value; \u2022 the fair value of an asset other than land is generally based on its depreciated replacement value; \u2022 productive trees in commercial native forests, which are recognised at their fair value less costs to sell; \u2022 derivative financial instruments, managed investment schemes, certain debt securities and investment properties after initial recognition, which are measured at fair value through profit and loss; \u2022 certain liabilities, most notably superannuation and some insurance claim provisions, which are subject to an actuarial assessment; and \u2022 available for sale investments which are measured at fair value with movements reflected in equity until the asset is derecognised. Assets, liabilities, revenue or expenses arise from past transactions or other past events, therefore estimates are recognised for those transactions or other events that on best information are expected to occur during each estimated financial reporting period. Where the transactions would result from an agreement between the government and other parties, the estimated transactions are only recognised when the agreement has, or there is reasonable expectation that it will, become irrevocable during the reporting period. These Estimated Financial Statements reflect management judgements and assumptions as of the date of authorisation for issue of 28 April 2010, taking into account government decisions and other circumstances as at that date. (F) Reporting entity The Victorian general government sector includes all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. The Victorian general government sector is not a separate entity but represents a sector within the State of Victoria whole of government reporting entity. The primary function of entities within the Victorian general government sector is to provide public services (outputs), which are mainly non-market in nature, for the collective consumption of the community, and involve the transfer or redistribution of revenue that is financed mainly through taxes and other compulsory levies. These entities are not-for-profit entities and apply, where appropriate, those paragraphs of accounting standards applicable to not-for-profit entities. (G) Basis of consolidation The Estimated Financial Statements present the consolidated assets and liabilities of all reporting entities in the Victorian general government sector, and their revenue, gains and expenses for the respective period, in accordance with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting and AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements . Other sectors of government, that is, the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors, are accounted for as an equity investment measured at the government's proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets of the PNFC sector and PFC sector entities before consolidation eliminations. Where the carrying amount of the entity's net assets before consolidation eliminations is less than zero the investment is measured at zero. Where control of an entity is expected to be obtained during the financial period, its results are included in the comprehensive operating statement from the date on which control would commence. Where control is expected to cease during a financial period, the entity's results are included for that part of the period for which control would exist. Where dissimilar accounting policies are adopted by entities and their effect is considered material, adjustments are made to ensure consistent policies are adopted in these Estimated Financial Statements. In the process of reporting the Victorian general government sector, all material transactions and balances between entities within the sector are eliminated. Details of significant entities consolidated within the sector are shown in Note 27 in these Estimated Financial Statements. Scope and presentation of financial statements Estimated comprehensive operating statement Revenue and expenses in the comprehensive operating statement are classified according to whether or not they arise from 'transactions' or 'other economic flows' consistent with AASB 1049. 'Transactions' and 'other economic flows' are defined by the Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods 2005 Cat. No. 5514.0 published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Note 24 Reconciliations to Government Finance Statistics identifies and reconciles convergence differences between GFS and the AASs. Transactions are those economic flows that are considered to arise as a result of policy decisions, usually interactions between two entities by mutual agreement. Transactions also include flows within an entity, such as depreciation where the owner is simultaneously acting as the owner of the depreciating asset and as the consumer of the service provided by the asset. Taxation is regarded as mutually agreed interactions between the government and taxpayers. Transactions can be in kind (e.g. assets provided/given free of charge or for nominal consideration) or where the final consideration is cash. Other economic flows are changes arising from market re-measurements. They include gains and losses from disposals, revaluations and impairments of non-current physical and intangible assets; actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit superannuation plans; fair value changes of financial instruments and agricultural assets; and depletion of natural assets (non-produced) from their use or removal. The 'net result' is equivalent to profit or loss derived in accordance with AASs. Estimated balance sheet Assets and liabilities are presented in liquidity order, with assets aggregated into financial assets and non-financial assets consistent with the GFS manual and AASB 1049. Current and non-current assets and liabilities (non-current being those assets or liabilities expected to be recovered or settled more than 12 months after the reporting period) are disclosed in the notes, where relevant. Estimated cash flow statement Cash flows are classified according to whether they arise from operating activities, investing activities, or financing activities. This classification is consistent with requirements under AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows . Estimated statement of changes in equity The estimated statement of changes in equity presents reconciliations of non-owner and owner changes in equity from opening balance at the beginning of the reporting period to the closing balance at the end of the reporting period. It also separately shows changes due to amounts recognised in the comprehensive result and amounts recognised in other comprehensive income related to other non-owner changes in equity. (H) Revenue from transactions Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue can be reliably measured. Taxation revenue Estimates of state taxation revenue are recognised upon the earlier of either the receipt by the State of a taxpayer's self assessment or the time the taxpayer's obligation to pay arises, pursuant to the issue of an assessment. Taxation revenue represents revenue received from the State's taxpayers and includes: \u2022 payroll tax; \u2022 land tax; \u2022 duties levied principally on conveyances and land transfers; \u2022 gambling taxes levied mainly on private lotteries, electronic gaming machines, casino operations and racing; \u2022 insurance duty relating to compulsory third party, life and non-life policies; \u2022 insurance company contributions to fire brigades; \u2022 motor vehicle taxes, including registration fees and duty on registrations and transfers; \u2022 other taxes, including landfill levies, licence fees and progressive recognition of upfront concession fees paid by Transurban in respect of Melbourne CityLink and gambling licence fees; and \u2022 levies (including the environmental levy) on statutory corporations in other sectors of government. Forecast assumption The State's taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves: \u2022 application of the Department of Treasury and Finance's economic forecasts, where there is a relationship between taxation revenue and economic variables. This enables an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced (e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment \u2022 and wages; for motor vehicle taxes, assessment of the outlook for demand for vehicles reflecting various economic influences; for gambling taxes, assessment of the outlook for consumer spending); \u2022 analysis of historical information and relationships using econometric and other statistical methods; and \u2022 consultation with private sector economists, industry associations, and relevant government authorities. Upfront concession notes received are progressively recognised over the remaining life of the applicable concession term. Some state taxes are sourced from tax bases which are particularly volatile. Hence, tax revenue from these sources is subject to substantial annual variation. Duty on land transfers is an example of a volatile tax base. Interest revenue Interest revenue includes the unwinding over time of the discount on financial assets and interest received on bank term deposits and other investments. Interest revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the financial asset. Net realised and unrealised gains and losses on the revaluation of investments do not form part of revenue from transactions, but are reported either as part of income from other economic flows in the net result or as unrealised gains or losses taken direct to equity, forming part of the total change in net worth in the estimated comprehensive result. Forecast assumption Forecast interest revenue arises from budget cash surpluses that are invested. Dividends, income tax equivalent and rate equivalent revenue This represents revenue received from other sectors of government. Revenue is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Forecast assumption The forecasts are provided by government business enterprises using their best available estimates. In determining forecast dividend payments, the following two general benchmarks are used: \u2022 fifty per cent of net profit after tax; or \u2022 dividends and income tax equivalent paid or payable of 65 per cent of pre tax profit. The exceptions: \u2022 the Transport Accident Commission, which is forecast to pay dividends of 50 per cent of Performance from Insurance Operations (PFIO); and \u2022 Treasury Corporation of Victoria, which pays dividends of 100 per cent of profit. Other commercial factors considered that will affect the dividend forecasts include the views of each agency's board of directors, the liquidity, operating cash flow and forecast cash requirements of each government business enterprise, gearing and interest cover of the business, accumulated surplus/(deficit) and any other specific commercial factors relating to individual businesses. Dividend and income tax equivalent forecasts can be significantly influenced by a number of factors, including the volatility of the financial markets and climatic conditions impacting on water corporations. Income raised under the National Tax Equivalent Regime (NTER), which is administered by the Australian Taxation Office, remains with the State. Sales of goods and services Revenue from the rendering of services Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion basis. The revenue is recognised when: \u2022 the amount of the revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and \u2022 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity or department. The stage of completion is measured by reference to labour hours supplied or as a percentage of total services to be performed. Revenue from the sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: \u2022 the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer; \u2022 the Victorian general government sector retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; \u2022 the amount of revenue, and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions, can be reliably measured; \u2022 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Victorian general government sector; and \u2022 the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Sale of goods and services includes regulatory fees which are recognised at the time the regulatory fee is billed. Forecast assumption Revenue arising from the sale of goods and rendering of services is forecast by taking into account all known factors, such as proposed fee increases imposed by departments and budget sector agencies in line with the Guidelines for Setting Fees and Charges (issued by the Department of Treasury and Finance) and/or indexation as provided for under the Monetary Units Act 2004 . Unless government policy states otherwise, fees will be set to recover the full costs of the goods or services provided. Under provisions in the Monetary Units Act 2004 , automatic indexation is applied to regulatory fees. Grants Grants mainly comprise funds provided by the Commonwealth to assist the state in meeting general or specific service delivery obligations, primarily for the purpose of aiding in the financing of the operations of the recipient, capital purposes and/or for on-passing to other recipients. Grants also include grants from other jurisdictions. Revenue is recognised when the State obtains control over the underlying assets. Forecast assumption The forecast receipt of financial assistance from the Commonwealth is determined on the latest available information at the time of preparation of the Estimated Financial Statements, taking into account the payment schedules and escalation factors relevant to each type of grant. Forecasts of Goods and Services Tax (GST) grants, are based on the state's assessment of the latest Commonwealth information on the national GST pool, and assume a move back towards trend growth from 2011-12. Victoria's share of GST for 2010-11 is based on Victoria's assessed relativity for that year published by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the Commonwealth Government's population projections. The Commonwealth Grants Commission calculates an assessed relativity as the average of the past three annual per capita relativities. The Victorian Government forecasts future assessed relativities by assuming that annual per capita relativities will move over the forecast period to equal the current (2010-11) assessed relativity. This projection is made on a basis excluding the impact of non-GST Commonwealth grants, and is then adjusted for the latest available estimates of non-GST Commonwealth grants. The forecast GST share is based on these projected assessed relativities and the Commonwealth Government's population projections. Other revenue Other current revenue includes non-property rental, fines, assets and services received free of charge, royalties, donations and gifts and other miscellaneous non-operating revenue. Forecast assumption The forecast of fines principally involves assessment of the behaviour of road users. Under provisions in the Monetary Units Act 2004 , automatic indexation is applied to fines. An indexation factor of 2.25 per cent has been applied for the forecast period. (I) Expenses from transactions Expenses are recognised when they are incurred, and reported in the financial year to which they relate. Employee expenses These expenses include all costs related to employment (other than superannuation which is accounted for separately) including wages and salaries, fringe benefits tax, leave entitlements, redundancy payments and WorkCover premiums. Forecast assumption Employee expenses are forecast on the basis of staffing profiles and current salaries, conditions and on-costs. For the forecast period, employee expenses are adjusted for approved wage agreements with allowance made for further changes in the future consistent with the Government's wage policy. Under this policy, costs associated with Enterprise Bargaining Agreement outcomes beyond the normal indexation factor used to escalate departmental output revenue, are funded from real and sustainable productivity improvements, cost savings and improved service delivery. Employee expense forecasts also reflect the impact of new initiatives. Superannuation interest expense and other superannuation expenses The superannuation expense is determined on the following basis: \u2022 in relation to defined contribution (i.e. accumulation) superannuation plans, the associated expense is simply the employer contributions that are paid or payable in respect of employees who are members of these plans during the reporting period; and \u2022 for defined benefit plans, the superannuation expense reflects the employer financed component of defined benefits that are expected to accrue over the reporting period (i.e. service cost), along with the superannuation interest expense. In addition, actuarial gains and losses, which are not classified as transactions, are reported separately as other economic flows and included in the net result. Forecast assumptions Future defined contribution superannuation expenses are based on assumptions regarding future salaries, interest rates and legislated contribution rates. Future defined benefit superannuation expenses are based on actuarial projections of the components outlined above. Depreciation and amortisation All infrastructure assets, buildings, plant and equipment and other non-current physical assets (excluding items under operating leases, assets held for sale and investment properties) that have a limited useful life are depreciated. Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight line basis, at rates that allocate the asset's value, less any estimated residual value, over its estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter, using the straight line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period. The following are typical estimated useful lives for the different asset classes. \u2022 Asset class \u2022 Useful life \u2022 Dwellings \u2022 Other buildings \u2022 Road pavement \u2022 Bridges \u2022 Plant, equipment and vehicles \u2022 Cultural assets (with finite useful lives) \u2022 40 to 50 years \u2022 30 to 60 years \u2022 60 years \u2022 90 years \u2022 3 -10 years \u2022 100 years Land, earthworks, land under declared roads, and core cultural assets, which are considered to have an indefinite life, are not depreciated. Depreciation is not recognised in respect of these assets because their service potential has not, in any material sense, been consumed during the reporting period. Intangible produced assets with finite useful lives are depreciated as an expense from transactions on a systematic (typically straight-line) basis over the asset's useful life. Depreciation begins when the asset is available for use, that is, when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortisation of intangible non-produced assets with finite useful life is not classified as a transaction and it is included in the net result as an other economic flow. These assets are assessed annually for impairment as set out in Note 1(K). Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not depreciated, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Forecast assumption Depreciation is forecast on the basis of known asset profiles, asset sales programs and approved new asset investment programs. The expense is based on the assumption that there will be no change in depreciation rates over the forecast period, but includes the estimated impact of future revaluation of assets. However, any future changes in depreciable lives, carrying value, residual value, or methodology would result in a change in future depreciation expense. Amortisation is forecast on the basis of the known profile of assets, approved new asset investment programs and projected asset sales. Interest expense Interest expense (excluding swap interest which is classified as an other economic flow) is recognised in the period in which it is incurred. Interest expense includes the following items: \u2022 interest on outstanding borrowings; \u2022 amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings; \u2022 finance lease charges; \u2022 the increase in financial liabilities and provisions due to the unwinding of discount to reflect the passage of time; and \u2022 borrowing costs of qualifying assets, in accordance with the paragraphs of AASB 123 Borrowing Costs applicable to not for profit public sector entities. The Victorian general government sector recognises borrowing costs immediately as an expense, even where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset Refer to the glossary of terms in Note 26 to these Estimated Financial Statements for explanation of interest expense items. Forecast assumption Estimates for interest expense are based on the forecast level of outstanding general government sector debt and expected changes in non-current financial liabilities and provisions. General government sector debt is expected to mainly comprise a fixed rate facility, and index linked securities from the Treasury Corporation of Victoria. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses generally represent the day to day running costs incurred in normal operations. Other operating expenses include: \u2022 supplies and services costs which are recognised as an expense in the reporting period in which they are incurred. The carrying amounts of any inventories held for distribution are expensed when distributed; and \u2022 bad and doubtful debts, which are assessed on a regular basis. Only bad debts considered as written off by mutual consent are classified as a transaction expense. Doubtful debts expense is recorded as an other economic flow included in the net result (refer to Note 1(K)). The provision for doubtful receivables is recorded in the balance sheet (see Note 1(L)). Forecast assumption Supplies and services expenses are forecast on the basis of experience and known activity changes, including the application of government policy such as savings strategies, changes in the method of service delivery, and the application of the appropriate economic parameters. An allowance is made for emerging demand that may arise over the forecast period. Bad and doubtful debts are forecast on the basis of experience and known activity changes. Grants and other transfers Grants and other transfers to third parties are recognised as an expense in the reporting period in which they are paid or payable. They include transactions such as grants, subsidies, personal benefit payments made in cash to individuals, and other transfer payments made to local government, non-government schools, community groups, and PNFCs and PFCs. Forecast assumption Grants and other transfer payments are forecast on the basis of known activity and adjusted by the appropriate economic parameters. Where payments are tied to third party revenue, such as Commonwealth grants for on-passing, forecasts are in line with estimated receipts. (J) Other economic flows included in net result Other economic flows measure the change in volume or value of assets or liabilities that do not result from transactions. Net gain/(loss) on sale of non-financial assets Any gain or loss on the sale of non-financial assets is recognised at the date of disposal and is determined after deducting from the proceeds the carrying value of the asset at that time. Impairment of non-financial assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (and intangible assets not yet available for use) are tested annually for impairment (i.e. as to whether their carrying values exceeds their recoverable amount, and so require write downs) and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. All other assets are assessed annually for indications of impairment, except for: \u2022 inventories (refer Note 1(M)); \u2022 financial assets (refer Note 1(L)); \u2022 certain biological assets related to agricultural activity (refer Note 1(M)); \u2022 investment properties that are measured at fair value (refer Note 1(M)); \u2022 non-current physical assets held-for-sale (refer Note 1(M)); and \u2022 assets arising from construction contracts (refer Note 1(M)). If there is an indication of impairment, the assets concerned are tested as to whether their carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. Where an asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, the difference is written off as an other economic flow, except to the extent that the write down can be debited to an asset revaluation surplus amount applicable to that class of asset. It is deemed that, in the event of the loss of an asset, the future economic benefits arising from the use of the asset will be replaced unless a specific decision to the contrary has been made. The recoverable amount for most assets is measured at the higher of depreciated replacement cost and fair value less costs to sell. The recoverable amount for assets held primarily to generate net cash inflows is measured at the higher of the present value of future cash flows expected to be obtained from the asset and fair value less costs to sell. Refer to Note 1(M) in relation to the recognition and measurement of non-financial assets. Net gain/(loss) on financial assets or liabilities at fair value Any gains or losses on disposal of financial assets or liabilities are recognised at the expected date of disposal and are determined after deducting from the proceeds the carrying value of the asset or liability at that time. Net gain/(loss) on financial instruments Net gain/(loss) on financial instruments includes: \u2022 realised and unrealised gains and losses from revaluations of financial instruments that are designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading; \u2022 impairment and reversal of impairment for financial instruments at amortised cost; and \u2022 disposals of financial assets. Revaluations of financial instruments at fair value Equities and managed investment schemes, and certain debt securities, are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition on the basis that the financial assets form part of a group of financial assets that are managed and have their performance evaluated by management in accordance with documented role strategies. The financial assets are subsequently stated at fair value, with any resultant gain/(loss) recognised in the net result as other economic flows. Any dividend or interest on a financial asset is recognised in the net result from transactions (refer Note 25 Financial Instruments). Net actuarial gains/(losses) on superannuation defined benefit plans These actuarial gains or losses reflect the change in the superannuation liability that arises due to differences between the assumptions used to calculate the superannuation expense from transactions and actual outcomes. The effect of any change in actuarial assumptions during the period is also included. Actuarial gains or losses are fully recognised in the period in which they occur. Forecast assumptions are detailed in Note 1(N). Other gains/(losses) from other economic flows Other gains/(losses) from other economic flows include the gains or losses from: \u2022 transfer of amounts from the reserves and/or accumulated surplus to net result due to disposal or derecognition or reclassification; \u2022 the revaluation of the present value of the long service leave liability due to changes in the bond interest rates; and \u2022 valuation changes associated with the indemnity to SECV for the electricity supply arrangements to the smelters of Alcoa of Australia Ltd. (K) Financial assets Forecast assumption The estimated 1 July 2010 opening balances of assets represent the audited carrying value as at 30 June 2009, revised for estimated movements during 2009-10. Cash and deposits Cash and deposits, including cash equivalents, comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, deposits at call and those highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes, and which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts, which are included as borrowings on the balance sheet. Forecast assumption Cash and deposits are assumed to be held at levels sufficient to cover operating requirements over the forecast period. Advances paid Advances paid represent inter-sector loans and advances, at fair value, made by the Victorian general government sector to the PNFC and PFC sectors, for policy rather than liquidity management purposes. They exclude equity contributions. Forecast assumption The estimated 1 July 2010 opening balance is based on the 2008-09 audited closing balance adjusted for revised activities. Repayments of existing balances are based on entities' activity schedules. Investments, loans and placements Investments are recognised and derecognised on trade date where purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Investments are classified in the following categories: \u2022 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; \u2022 loans and receivables; \u2022 held to maturity investments; and \u2022 available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition. Investments held for trading purposes are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss as other economic flows. Any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset is recognised in profit or loss as transactions. Where the State has the positive intent and ability to hold investments to maturity, they are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. Forecast assumption All surplus cash resources for the period 2010-11 to 2013-14 are assumed to be held as financial assets (investments) pending repayment of debt when appropriate. Loans and receivables - term deposits Term deposits with maturity greater than three months, trade receivables, loans and other receivables are recorded at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Available for sale financial assets Other investments held by Victorian general government sector entities are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the net result as an other economic flow for the period. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 25: Financial Instruments. Receivables Receivables consist predominately of debtors in relation to goods and services, taxes and fines, accrued investment income, and GST input tax credits recoverable. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any accumulated impairment losses. A provision for doubtful receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the debts may not be collected and bad debts are written off when identified (refer to Note 1(J)). Forecast assumption Receivables are forecast on the basis of revenue activity levels (refer to Note 1(O) for finance lease receivables). Investments accounted for using the equity method Investments in associates are accounted for in the Estimated Financial Statements using the equity method. Associates are those entities over which the State exercises significant influence, but not control. Under this method, the State's share of the post acquisition profits or losses of associates is recognised in the net result of the estimated operating statement and its share of post acquisition movements in revaluation surpluses and any other reserves is recognised in both the estimated comprehensive operating statement and the estimated statement of changes in equity. The cumulative post acquisition movements are adjusted against the cost of the investment. Joint ventures are contractual arrangements between the State or a subsidiary entity and one or more other parties to undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. Joint control only exists when the strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control (the venturers). Interests in jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets are accounted for by recognising in the estimated financial statements, the proportional share of the assets, liabilities and any income and expenses of such joint ventures. Interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for in the Estimated Financial Statements using the equity method, as applied to investments in associates. Forecast assumption Investments in existing joint venture operations and assets are assumed to remain unchanged during the forecast period. Investments in other sector entities Other sectors of government, that is the PNFC and PFC sectors, are accounted for as an equity investment in other sectors measured at the government's proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets of the PNFC sector and PFC sector entities before consolidation eliminations. Where the carrying amount of net assets before consolidation eliminations is less than zero the investment is measured at zero. Any change in the carrying amount of the investment from period to period is accounted for as if the change in carrying amount is a change in fair value and accounted for in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and AASB 1049. Forecast assumption Investments in other sector entities are estimated based on their audited net assets as at 30 June 2009, adjusted by management estimates of subsequent operating results and distributions. Impairment of financial assets At the end of each reporting period, the State assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. All financial assets, except those measured at fair value through profit or loss, are subject to annual review for impairment. Bad and doubtful debts for financial assets are assessed on a regular basis. Those bad debts considered as written off by mutual consent are classified as a transaction expense. Bad debts not written off by mutual consent and the allowance for doubtful receivables are classified as other economic flows. In assessing impairment of statutory (non-contractual) financial assets which are not financial instruments, the Victorian general government sector entities apply professional judgement in assessing materiality using estimates, averages and other computational methods in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . (L) Non-financial assets The estimated 1 July 2010 opening balances of assets represent the audited carrying value as at 30 June 2009, revised for estimated movements during 2009-10. Inventories Inventories include goods and other property held either for sale, or for distribution at zero or nominal cost, or for consumption in the ordinary course of business operations. It includes land held for sale and excludes depreciable assets. Inventories held for distribution are measured at cost, adjusted for any loss of service potential. All other inventories, including land held-for-sale, are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Bases used in assessing loss of service potential for inventories held for distribution include current replacement cost and technical or functional obsolescence. Technical obsolescence occurs when an item still functions for some or all of the tasks it was originally acquired to do, but no longer matches existing technologies. Functional obsolescence occurs when an item no longer functions the way it did when it was first acquired. Cost is assigned to land held for sale (undeveloped, under development and developed) and to other high value, low volume inventory items on a specific identification of cost basis. Cost for all other inventory is measured on the basis of weighted average cost. Inventories acquired for no cost or nominal consideration are measured at current replacement cost at the date of acquisition. Forecast assumption Inventories forecast to be purchased are valued at the forecast cost. Non-financial assets held-for-sale Non-financial assets (or disposal group assets) classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and are not subject to depreciation. Non-financial assets (or disposal group assets), related liabilities and financial assets are treated as current and classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset's sale (or disposal group sale) is expected to be completed within twelve months from the date of classification. Forecast assumption Assets held-for-sale are forecast on the basis of experience and known asset sales programs including the application of government policy such as asset management strategies and changes in the method of output delivery. Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment All non-current physical assets, are measured initially at cost and subsequently revalued at fair value less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Non-current physical assets such as national parks, other Crown land and heritage assets are measured at fair value with regard to the property's highest and best use after due consideration is made for any legal or constructive restrictions imposed on the asset, public announcements or commitments made in relation to the intended use of the asset. Theoretical opportunities that may be available in relation to the asset are not taken into account until it is virtually certain that the restrictions will no longer apply. Refer to the section below on the restrictive nature of cultural and heritage assets, Crown land and infrastructure. Road network assets (including earthworks of the declared road networks) are measured at fair value, determined by reference to the asset's depreciated replacement cost. Land under declared roads acquired prior to 1 July 2008 is measured at fair value. Land under declared roads acquired on or after 1 July 2008 is measured initially at cost of acquisition and subsequently at fair value. The fair value of cultural depreciated assets and collections, heritage assets and other non-current physical assets that the State intends to preserve because of their unique historical, cultural or environmental attributes, is measured at the replacement cost of the asset less, where applicable, accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of such cost to reflect the already consumed or expired future economic benefits of the asset and any accumulated impairment. The fair value of infrastructure systems and plant, equipment and vehicles, is normally determined by reference to the asset's depreciated replacement cost. For plant, equipment and vehicles, existing depreciated historical cost is generally a reasonable proxy for depreciated replacement cost because of the short lives of the assets concerned. Leasehold improvements The cost of leasehold improvements is capitalised as an asset and depreciated over the remaining term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is the shorter. Restrictive nature of cultural and heritage assets, Crown land and infrastructure Certain agencies hold cultural assets, heritage assets, Crown land and infrastructure, which are deemed worthy of preservation because of the social rather than financial benefits they provide to the community. Consequently, there are certain limitations and restrictions imposed on their use and/or disposal. Non-current physical assets arising from finance leases Refer to Note 1(O). Revaluations of non-current physical assets Non-current physical assets are measured at fair value in accordance with the Financial Reporting Directions (FRDs) issued by the Minister for Finance. A full revaluation normally occurs every five years, based upon the asset's Government Purpose Classification, but may occur more frequently if fair value assessments indicate material changes in values. Independent valuers are generally used to conduct these scheduled revaluations. Certain specialised infrastructure assets are revalued using specialised advisors. Any interim revaluations are determined in accordance with the requirements of the FRDs. Revaluation increases or decreases arise from differences between an asset's carrying value and fair value. Net revaluation increases (where the carrying amount of a class of assets is increased as a result of a revaluation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the asset revaluation surplus. However, the net revaluation increase shall be recognised in the net result to the extent that it reverses a net revaluation decrease in respect of the same class of property, plant and equipment previously recognised as an expense (other economic flows) in the net result. Net revaluation decreases are recognised immediately as other economic flows in the net result, except that the net revaluation decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that a credit balance exists in the asset revaluation surplus in respect of the same class of property, plant and equipment. The net revaluation decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the asset revaluation surplus. Revaluation increases and decreases relating to individual assets within a class of property, plant and equipment, are offset against one another within that class but are not offset in respect of assets in different classes. Any asset revaluation surplus is not normally transferred to accumulated funds on derecognition of the relevant asset. Forecast assumption The value of non-current physical assets will change during the forecast period to account for acquisitions, disposals and the impact of depreciation and revaluation. New investments in assets are valued at the forecast purchase price or, where appropriate, recognised progressively over the estimated construction period. The forward estimates include the estimated impact of revaluations of non-current physical assets. These estimates have been derived based on examination and extrapolation of historical trends in asset revaluations by major asset class. Biological assets Productive trees in commercial native forests and breeding livestock are recognised as biological assets. These biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell and are revalued at 30 June each year. For breeding livestock, fair value is based on the amount that could be expected to be received from the disposal of livestock. For productive trees, revaluation to fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on expected net future cash flows, discounted by a current market determined rate. An increase or decrease in the fair value of these biological assets is recognised as an other economic flow in the net result. Forecast assumption The value of biological assets will change during the forecast period to account for acquisitions, disposals and the estimated impact of revaluations. Intangible assets Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs incurred subsequent to initial acquisition are capitalised when it is expected that additional future economic benefits will flow to the Victorian general government sector (refer to Note 1(J)). Forecast assumption The value of intangible assets during the forecast period reflects forecast acquisitions, disposals and the impact of depreciation or amortisation. Other non-financial assets Other non-financial assets include prepayments which represent payments in advance of receipt of goods or services or that part of expenditure made in one accounting period covering a term extending beyond that period. Forecast assumption Unless otherwise stated, prepayments for expenditure extending into the next accounting period are assumed to apply only to minor contractual obligations for goods and services. Partnerships Victoria projects Infrastructure projects that are approved-in-principle by the government for possible delivery under the Partnerships Victoria model are initially included in the Estimated Financial Statements as non-current physical assets (with associated financing and depreciation costs). A final decision on whether an infrastructure project is to proceed with a Partnerships Victoria delivery approach is made following evaluation of bids arising from the tender process for the project, based on an assessment of value for money and satisfaction of the public interest. If, at the conclusion of the tender process, a decision is made to proceed with a Partnerships Victoria delivery approach, the budget treatment will be adjusted as required, to convert the applicable budgeted asset investment, depreciation and financing flows to ensure appropriate disclosure. Due to a lack of accounting guidance applicable to grantors on the recognition and measurement by the State of assets arising from certain service concession arrangements, there has been no change in policy and those assets are not currently recognised (also refer to Note 1(Q)). Impairment of non-financial assets Refer to Note 1(K). (M) Liabilities Deposits held and advances received Deposits held include deposits, security deposits, and trust fund provisions held on behalf of public sector or private sector bodies. Advances received include loans and other repayable funds from public sector bodies for policy purposes. Forecast assumption These are forecast on the basis of estimated activity in trust funds and on agreed loan activities between central government and agencies. Borrowings The State's borrowings mainly represent funds raised from the following sources: \u2022 public borrowings mainly raised through the Treasury Corporation of Victoria; \u2022 the residual amount outstanding for loans raised in previous years by the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the State; and \u2022 finance leases (refer to Note 1(O)) and other interest bearing arrangements. Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, being the cost of the borrowings, net of transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between the initial recognised amount and the redemption value being recognised in net result over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method. Forecast assumption Borrowing estimates are based on the ability to repay maturing debt and the need to finance capital expenditure. Payables Payables consist predominantly of accounts payable and other sundry liabilities. Accounts payable represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Victorian general government sector prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid, and arise when the Victorian general government sector becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of those goods and services. Other liabilities included in payables mainly consist of unearned/prepaid income, goods and services tax and fringe benefits tax payables. Payables are initially recognised at fair value, being the cost of the goods and services, and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Unearned income liability includes deferred income from concession notes. Forecast assumption For the forecast period, accounts payable are based on known movements in contractual arrangements, other outstanding payables and historical experience. The unearned income liability relating to concession notes will reduce each year as income is progressively brought to account over the remaining period of the concession term. The estimated changes in other components are based on historical experience. Superannuation At each forward estimate reporting date, a liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation is recognised. This is measured as the difference between the estimated present value of accrued liabilities at the reporting date and the estimated net market value of the superannuation schemes' assets at that date. The present value of accrued liabilities is based upon future payments which are expected to arise due to the projected membership at each reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future salary levels and the experience of employee departures. In accordance with prevailing accounting standards, expected future payments are discounted to present values using rates applying to long term Commonwealth Government Bonds. The superannuation liability recognised in the estimated balance sheet also allows for any past service cost that has not yet been recognised in the estimated operating statement. Forecast assumptions The superannuation liability at future balance dates is estimated in accordance with the above policy by the actuaries of the various defined benefit superannuation schemes. These estimates are based on a number of demographic and financial assumptions which include, in particular, an expected return on the assets of the schemes and a discount rate for determining the present value of accrued liabilities. Consistent with the long term actuarial assumptions, the expected return on assets is assumed to remain constant across the budget and forecast periods. The discount and inflation rates that are adopted are based on prevailing long term Commonwealth Government Bonds (both nominal and inflation linked) which are also assumed to remain constant across the forward estimates period. Actual experience may differ significantly from assumptions which may cause significant variations in the reported superannuation liability. Any such variation would primarily be reported under other economic flows in the estimated operating statement. The table below provides additional information regarding the forecast assumptions for the budget and forward years for each relevant defined benefit superannuation scheme.

(b) The expected return on assets stated is gross of tax. Estimated tax payments are explicitly allowed for in the calculation process. (c) In accordance with accounting standards, the discount rate is based on the longest dated fixed interest Commonwealth Government bond rate. The rate stated above is an annual effective rate, gross of tax. (d) Wages growth is based on actuarial expectations. (e) For these schemes, the inflation rate assumed by the actuary reflects market expectations of price inflation as implied based on the relationship between the yields on Commonwealth Government bonds, both nominal and inflation linked, at the reporting date. This varies from previous years when the inflation assumption was based upon long term actuarial expectations. (f) Pensions payable from both the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Fund and Constitutionally Protected Schemes are linked to wages growth, not inflation. The expected return on assets, as shown above, is determined by weighting the expected long term return for each asset class by the target allocation of assets to each class (as detailed in the table below). Asset allocations Asset class Per cent Domestic equity 29.3 International equity 27.9 Domestic and International debt assets 19.0 Property 9.0 Cash 2.4 Other (inc. private equity, hedge funds and infrastructure) 12.3 Total 100.0 Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Employee benefits Provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and long service leave for services rendered to the reporting date. Provisions made in respect of other employee benefits are measured based on their expected settlement. Provisions which are expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. Provisions which are not expected to be settled within 12 months are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the State in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Regardless of the expected timing of settlement, provisions made in respect of employee benefits are classified as a current liability unless there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, in which case it would be classified as a non-current liability. The non-current liability includes long service leave entitlements accrued for employees with less than seven years of continuous service. Employee benefits on costs such as payroll tax, workers compensation and superannuation are recognised separately from the provision for employee benefits. Forecast assumption Employee benefits are forecast on the basis of staffing profiles and current salaries and conditions. For the forecast period, employee benefits are adjusted for approved wage agreements with an allowance made for future movements. Other provisions Other provisions are recognised when the Victorian general government sector has a present obligation, the future sacrifice of economic benefits is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. Other provisions principally include a liability for outstanding insurance claims, which is independently assessed by actuaries. This liability covers claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not yet reported, and the anticipated costs of settling those claims. Because of the inherent uncertainty in the estimate of the outstanding insurance claims, a risk margin is included. The risk margin is set to increase the probability that the liability estimate will be sufficient. The actuaries take into account projected inflation and other factors to arrive at expected future payments. These are then discounted at the reporting date using a market determined, risk free discount rate. Forecast assumption The level of outstanding insurance claims liability at the end of each forecast year is based on historical trends, existing actuarial valuations and projections adjusted for forecast activity levels. (N) Leases A lease is a right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in exchange for payment. Leases are classified at their inception as either operating or finance leases based on the economic substance of the agreement so as to reflect the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. Leases of infrastructure, property, plant and equipment are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership from the lessor to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance leases State as lessor Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables. Finance lease receivables are initially recorded at amounts equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments receivable plus the present value of any unguaranteed residual value expected to accrue at the end of the lease term. Finance lease receipts are apportioned between periodic interest income and reduction of the lease receivable over the term of the lease in order to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease. State as lessee At the commencement of the lease term, finance leases are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at amounts equal to the fair value of the lease property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payment, each determined at the inception of the lease. The lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the outstanding lease liability and the periodic finance expense which is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease and charged directly to the comprehensive operating statement. Contingent rentals associated with finance leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Operating leases State as lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. All incentives for the agreement of a new or renewed operating lease are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration agreed for the use of the leased asset, irrespective of the incentive's nature or form or the timing of payments. In the event that lease incentives are given to the lessee, the aggregate cost of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term, on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern over which the economic benefit of the leased asset is diminished. State as lessee Operating lease payments, including any contingent rentals, are recognised as an expense in the comprehensive operating statement on a straight line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the benefits derived from the use of the leased asset. The leased asset is not recognised in the balance sheet. All incentives for the agreement of a new or renewed operating lease are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration agreed for the use of the leased asset, irrespective of the incentive's nature or form or the timing of payments. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, the aggregate cost of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Forecast assumption Unless otherwise stated, existing leases are assumed to be replaced by leases with similar terms and conditions. (O) Contingent assets and contingent liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet. However, they are disclosed in Chapter 7: Contingencies and Liabilities of this Budget Paper No. 4. (P) Service concession arrangements The State enters into certain arrangements to design and construct or upgrade assets used to provide public services. These arrangements are typically complex and usually include the provision of operational and maintenance services for a specified period of time. These arrangements are often referred to as either public private partnerships (PPPs) or service concession arrangements (SCAs). These SCAs usually take one of two main forms. In the more common form, the State pays the operator over the period of the arrangement, subject to specified performance criteria being met. At the date of commitment to the principal provisions of the arrangement, these estimated periodic payments are allocated between a component related to the design and construction or upgrading of the asset and components related to the ongoing operation and maintenance of the asset. The former component is accounted for as a lease payment (refer to Note 1(O)). The remaining components are accounted for as commitments for operating costs which are expensed in the comprehensive operating statement as they are incurred. The other, less common form of SCA, is one in which the State grants to an operator, for a specified period of time, the right to collect fees from users of the SCA asset, in return for which the operator constructs the asset and has the obligation to supply agreed upon services, including maintenance of the asset for the period of the concession. These private sector entities typically lease land, and sometimes State works, from the State and construct infrastructure. At the end of the concession period, the land and State works, together with the constructed facilities, will be returned to the State. Significant service concession arrangements include the CityLink network, which has a nominal term of 33.5 years expiring 15 January 2034 and EastLink, which is also a tollway, with a nominal term of 35 years expiring 30 November 2043. There is currently no authoritative accounting guidance applicable to grantors (the State) on the recognition and measurement of the right of the State to receive assets from such concession arrangements. Due to the lack of such guidance, there has been no change to existing policy and those assets are not currently recognised. The impact that may occur as a result of possible changes to the accounting by the State cannot be reliably estimated and is not accounted for in the Estimated Financial Statements. (Q) Accounting for the goods and services tax Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of goods and services tax (GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable, in which case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of an asset or part of an item of expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the balance sheet. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are included as an operating cash flow. (R) Estimated cash flow statement For the purposes of the estimated cash flow statement, cash and deposits, including cash equivalents, comprise cash on hand, cash at bank, deposits at call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. (S) Foreign currency All foreign currency transactions during the financial year are brought to account using the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. Foreign monetary items existing at the end of the reporting period are translated at the closing rate at the date of the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences are recognised in other economic flows in comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, in the period in which they arise. (T) Prospective accounting changes The following AASs have been issued by the AASB up until the date of issue of these Estimated Financial Statements. The following AASs will become operative during the forecast period, in the financial years subsequent to the 2010-11 budget year: \u2022 AASB 9 Financial Instruments , operative from 1 January 2013; \u2022 2009-11 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 [AASBs 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 136, 139, 1023, 1038, and Interpretations 10 and 12] , operative from 1 January 2013; and \u2022 2009-12 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards [AASBs 5, 8, 108, 110, 112, 119, 133, 137, 139, 1023 and 1031 and Interpretations 2, 4, 16, 1039 and 1052] , operative from 1 January 2011. The impact of all prospective changes has not yet been determined, and therefore not incorporated in the Estimated Financial Statements.

Note 25: Financial instruments - financial risk management objectives and policies The 2008-09 Financial Report for the State of Victoria (Note 32) contains a comprehensive disclosure of the State's (including the general government sector's) financial risk management objectives and policies. There has been no subsequent substantive change to these objectives and policies. In relation to the general government sector, the following is a summary of how these risks are reviewed and managed. The general government sector's principal holdings of financial instruments comprise domestic loans and long term liabilities, finance leases, cash, Australian currency term deposits and other debt securities. These financial instruments arise primarily as a consequence of the need to raise finance for the State's operations including investment in assets or from the effective management of financial surpluses. The State also has various other financial assets and liabilities such as receivables and payables, which arise directly from its operations. Although certain State controlled entities outside the general government sector may enter into derivative transactions, none of these entities are included in the general government sector. Responsible and prudent financial risk management is carried out individually by each consolidated entity, in accordance with the State's risk management framework, developed by the Department of Treasury and Finance (DTF) and established by the Treasurer. The State's risk management framework comprises the following key components: \u2022 the Treasurer is responsible for the approval and establishment of the prudential framework containing policies and guidelines on financial risk management; \u2022 DTF is responsible for providing advice to the Treasurer on the management of the State's financial risk; \u2022 DTF's Risk Management Committee is responsible for monitoring the balance sheet and risk management activities of the State and advising or making recommendations to the DTF board; \u2022 the TCV is the State's central borrowing authority and financing advisor. An independent Prudential Supervisor and Prudential Auditor are appointed by the Treasurer to monitor TCV's compliance with its prudential framework; \u2022 the Victorian Funds Management Corporation (VFMC) acts as the State's central investment fund manager through the provision of expertise in investment strategy development and delivery of funds management services in accordance with each entity's investment objectives; and \u2022 all entities are responsible for the day-to-day operational management of their financial instruments and associated risks in accordance with the Treasury Management Guidelines. It is not the State's policy to enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. The main risks arising from the State's financial instruments are fair value and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and equity price risk. Interest rate risk The general government sector adopts a conservative risk philosophy, and operates within prescribed portfolio management guidelines to limit the impact on the budget of adverse movements in interest rates within acceptable bounds. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Only a small portion of the State's financial instruments are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk. The majority of the State's exposure to interest rate risk arises from fair value interest rate risk in relation to the State's long-term debt obligations with fixed interest rates. The State's borrowings are mainly managed by TCV, the State's central borrowing authority. Interest rate risk inherent in TCV's asset and liability management activities is monitored on a daily basis against TCV Board approved limits using the value at risk methodology. Value at risk is a measure of the estimated loss faced by TCV within a certain level of confidence over a given holding period under normal market conditions. The value at risk is based on the historical movement of prices, yield and spread of potential losses a portfolio may incur over a certain period. The State's policy for the management of interest rate risk on general government borrowings is to achieve relative certainty of interest cost while seeking to minimise net borrowing costs within portfolio risk management guidelines. Generally, this is achieved by undertaking fixed rate borrowings with relatively even maturity profiles. Over 95 per cent of the State's borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest. Credit risk The general government sector's maximum exposure to credit risk, in relation to each class of financial asset, is the carrying amount of those assets in the estimated balance sheet. With respect to credit risk arising from financial assets, which mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, available for sale assets and receivables, the exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. Cash equivalents and available for sale investments are mainly managed through the State's principal borrowing and investing authorities. These corporations manage credit risks by avoiding concentration of exposures to any one counterparty and having a wide range of approved counterparties. Entities in the general government sector manage other receivables, predominantly debtors in relation to goods and services, statutory debtors in relation to taxes and fines, accrued investment income, and GST input tax credits recoverable, in accordance with guidelines consistent with the compliance framework issued by the Minister for Finance. A prudent level of provisions for doubtful receivables is included in the estimated balance sheet. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from being unable to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The State is exposed to liquidity risk mainly through the maturity of its external borrowings raised from TCV and the need to fund cash deficits. TCV, as the State's central treasury, has the responsibility of ensuring the State's liquidity needs can be met at all times and has in place liquidity policies to ensure that it can meet its obligations in this area. The State also manages liquidity through rigorous cash flow and maturities planning and monitoring, including the annual budget process and through holding high quality liquid assets. Foreign currency risk The general government sector has no interest bearing liabilities or financial assets denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk arising from the State's offshore funding program is managed primarily through TCV using currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options. It is the State's policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness. Equity price risk The general government sector is exposed to equity price risk in equities and managed investment schemes. Such investments are allocated and traded to match investment objectives appropriate to the State's liabilities. The equity price risk is limited through diversification of the investment portfolio. This is determined by VFMC and reflected in the Investment Risk Management Plan approved by the Treasurer, and in accordance with the Borrowing and Investments Powers Act 1987 , and the prudential supervisory policies and framework of the State. Note 26: Glossary of technical terms The following is a summary of the major technical terms used in this budget. ABS GFS manual The ABS publication Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods 2005 as updated from time to time. Advances paid Loans acquired for policy rather than liquidity management purposes. Included are long and short-term loans, non-marketable debentures and long and short-term promissory agreements (bond and bills) issued to public sector units for achieving government policy objectives. Capital grants Amounts payable or receivable for capital purposes for which no economic benefits of equal value are receivable or payable in return. Cash surplus/deficit Net cash flows from operating activities plus net cash flows from acquisition and disposal of non-financial assets (less dividends paid for the PNFC and PFC sectors). Cash surplus/deficit - ABS GFS version Equal to the cash surplus deficit (above) less the value of assets acquired under finance leases and similar arrangements. Comprehensive result The net result of all items of income and expense recognised for the period. It is the aggregate of operating result and other movements in equity. Current grants Amounts payable or receivable for current purposes for which no economic benefits of equal value are receivable or payable in return. Financial asset A financial asset is any asset that is: (a) cash; (b) an equity instrument of another entity; (c) a contractual right: \u2212 to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or \u2212 to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity; or (d) a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is: \u2212 a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments; or \u2212 a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments. Fiscal aggregates Analytical balances that are useful for macroeconomic analysis purposes, including assessing the impact of a government and its sectors on the economy. AASB 1049 prescribes: net operating balance, net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance), change in net worth (comprehensive result), net worth and cash surplus/deficit. Additional fiscal aggregates not included in AASB 1049 are net debt, net financial worth, net financial liabilities. Government units Legal entities established by political processes which have legislative, judicial or executive authority over other institutional units within a given area and which: (i) provide goods and services to the community and/or individuals free of charge or at prices that are not economically significant; and (ii) redistribute income and wealth by means of taxes and other compulsory transfers. Government Finance Statistics Government Finance Statistics (GFS) enables policymakers and analysts to study developments in the financial operations, financial position and liquidity situation of the government. More details about the GFS can be found in the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) GFS manual titled Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods 2005 . General government sector The general government sector comprises all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. General government services include those which are mainly non-market in nature, those which are largely for collective consumption by the community, and those which involve the transfer or redistribution of income. These services are financed mainly through taxes, other compulsory levies and user charges. A listing of all entities comprising the general government sector is included at Note 27. Grants Transactions in which one unit provides goods, services, assets (or extinguishes a liability) or labour to another unit without receiving approximately equal value in return. Grants can either be of a current or capital nature (see current grants and capital grants). While grants to governments may result in the provision of some goods or services to the transferor, they do not give the transferor a claim to receive directly benefits of approximately equal value. Receipt and sacrifice of approximately equal value may occur, but only by coincidence. For example, governments are not obliged to provide commensurate benefits, in the form of goods or services, to particular taxpayers in return for their taxes. For this reason, grants are referred to by the AASB as involuntary transfers and are termed non-reciprocal transfers. Grants can be paid as general purpose grants which refers to grants which are not subject to conditions regarding their use. Alternatively, they may be paid as specific purpose grants which are paid for a particular purpose and/or have conditions attached regarding their use. Grants for on passing All grants paid to one institutional sector (e.g. a state-based general government entity) to be passed on to another institutional sector (e.g. local government or a private non-profit institution). Institutional unit An economic entity that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. Interest expense Costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. It includes interest on advances, loans, overdrafts, bonds and bills, deposits, interest components of finance lease repayments, and amortisation of discounts or premiums in relation to borrowings. It includes borrowing costs on qualifying assets. Key fiscal aggregates Referred to as analytical balances in the ABS GFS manual, key fiscal aggregates are data identified as useful for macroeconomic analysis purposes, including assessing the impact of a government and its sectors on the economy. They are: opening net worth, net operating balance, net lending/(borrowing), change in net worth due to revaluations, change in net worth due to other changes in the volume of assets, total change in net worth, closing net worth and cash surplus/(deficit). Net acquisition of non-financial assets (from transactions) Purchases (and other acquisitions) of non-financial assets less sales (or disposals) of non-financial assets less depreciation plus changes in inventories and other movements in non-financial assets. Includes only those increases or decreases in non-financial assets resulting from transactions and therefore excludes write offs, impairment write downs and revaluations. Net cash from investments in financial assets (liquidity management purposes) Net cash flows from investments in financial assets (liquidity management purposes) is cash receipts from liquidation or repayment of investments in financial assets for liquidity management purposes less cash payments for such investments. Investment for liquidity management purposes means making funds available to others with no policy intent and with the aim of earning a commercial rate of return. Net cash from investments in financial assets (policy purposes) Net cash flows from investments in financial assets (policy purposes) is cash receipts from the repayment and liquidation of investments in financial assets for policy purposes less cash payments for acquiring financial assets for policy purposes. Acquisition of financial assets for policy purposes is distinguished from investments in financial assets (liquidity management purposes) by the underlying government motivation for acquiring the assets. Acquisition of financial assets for policy purposes is motivated by government policies such as encouraging the development of certain industries or assisting citizens affected by natural disaster. Net gain on equity investments in other sector entities Net gain on equity investments in other sector entities measured at proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets/(liabilities) comprises the net gains relating to the equity held by the general government sector in other sector entities (i.e. PNFC and PFC entities). It arises from a change in the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiaries. The net gains are measured based on the proportional share of the subsidiary's carrying amount of net assets/(liabilities) before elimination of inter sector balances. Net debt Net debt equals sum of deposits held, advances received, government securities, loans and other borrowing less the sum of cash and deposits, advances paid and investments, loans and placements, and investment in general government sector entities using the equity method. Net financial liabilities Total liabilities less financial assets, other than equity in PNFCs and PFCs. This measure is broader than net debt as it includes significant liabilities, other than borrowings (e.g. accrued employee liabilities such as superannuation and long service leave entitlements). For the PNFC and PFC sectors, it is equal to negative net financial worth. Net lending/borrowing The financing requirement of government, calculated as the net operating balance less the net acquisition of non-financial assets. It also equals transactions in financial assets less transactions in liabilities. A positive result reflects a net lending position and a negative result reflects a net borrowing position. Net result Net result is a measure of financial performance of the operations for the period. It is the net result of items of revenue, gains and expenses (including losses) recognised for the period, excluding those that are classified as 'other non-owner movements in equity'. Net result from transactions/net operating balance Net result from transactions or net operating balance is a key fiscal aggregate and is revenue from transactions minus expenses from transactions. It is a summary measure of the ongoing sustainability of operations. It excludes gains and losses resulting from changes in price levels and other changes in the volume of assets. It is the component of the change in net worth that is due to transactions and can be attributed directly to government policies. Net worth Assets less liabilities. It is an economic measure of wealth and reflects the contribution of jurisdictions to the wealth of Australia. Net financial worth Net financial worth is equal to financial assets minus liabilities. It is a broader measure than net debt in that it incorporates provisions made (such as superannuation, but excluding depreciation and bad debts) as well as holdings of equity. Net financial worth includes all classes of financial assets and liabilities, only some of which are included in net debt. Non-financial assets Non-financial assets are all assets that are not financial assets. It includes inventories, land, buildings, infrastructure, road networks, plant and equipment, cultural and heritage assets, intangibles and biological assets such as commercial forests. Non-financial public sector (NFPS) The non-financial public sector represents the consolidated transactions and assets and liabilities of the general government and PNFC sectors. In compiling statistics for the non-financial public sector, transactions and debtor creditor relationships between sub-sectors are eliminated to avoid double counting. Non-produced assets Non-produced assets are assets needed for production that have not themselves been produced. They include land, subsoil assets, and certain intangible assets. Non-produced intangibles are intangible assets needed for production that have not themselves been produced. They include constructs of society such as patents. Non-profit institution A legal or social entity that is created for the purpose of producing or distributing goods and services but is not permitted to be a source of income, profit or other financial gain for the units that establish, control or finance it. Other economic flows Other economic flows are changes in the volume or value of an asset or liability that do not result from transactions. It includes gains and losses from disposals, revaluations and impairments of non-current physical and intangible assets; actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit superannuation plans; fair value changes of financial instruments and agricultural assets; and depletion of natural assets (non-produced) from their use or removal. In simple terms, other economic flows are changes arising from market remeasurements. Payables Includes short and long-term trade debt and accounts payable, grants and interest payable. Public financial corporations sector Public financial corporations (PFC) are bodies primarily engaged in the provision of financial intermediation services or auxiliary financial services. They are able to incur financial liabilities on their own account (e.g. taking deposits, issuing securities or providing insurance services). The public financial corporations sector includes the Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV) and the Transport Accident Commission (TAC). Estimates are not published for the public financial corporations sector. A listing of all PFCs controlled by the Victorian government is included at Note 27. Public non-financial corporations sector The public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sector comprises bodies mainly engaged in the production of goods and services (of a non-financial nature) for sale in the market place at prices that aim to recover most of the costs involved (e.g. water and port authorities). In general, PNFCs are legally distinguishable from the governments which own them. A listing of all PNFCs controlled by the Victorian Government is included at Note 27. Quasi corporation An unincorporated enterprise that functions as if it were a corporation, has the same relationship with its owner as a corporation, and keeps a separate set of accounts. Receivables Receivables includes short and long-term trade credit and accounts receivable, grants, taxes and interest receivable. Sale of goods and services Refers to revenue from the direct provision of goods and services and includes fees and charges for services rendered, fees from regulatory services, and work done as an agent for private enterprises. It also includes rental income under operating leases and on produced assets such as buildings and entertainment, but excludes rent income from the use of non-produced assets such as land. User charges includes sale of goods and services revenue. Superannuation interest expense Superannuation interest expense reflects the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, due to the fact that benefits are one period closer to settlement, net of the expected return on superannuation assets. Other superannuation Includes all superannuation expenses from transactions except the superannuation interest expense. That is, it primarily reflects employer contributions to defined contribution plans along with the current service cost associated with defined benefit superannuation, which is the increase in entitlements associated with the employment services provided by employees in the current period. Superannuation actuarial gains/losses are excluded as they are considered other economic flows. Transactions Transactions are those economic flows that are considered to arise as a result of policy decisions, usually an interaction between two entities by mutual agreement. They also include flows within an entity such as depreciation where the owner is simultaneously acting as the owner of the depreciating asset and as the consumer of the service provided by the asset. Taxation is regarded as mutually agreed interactions between the government and taxpayers. Transactions can be in kind (e.g. assets provided/given free of charge or for nominal consideration) or where the final consideration is cash. In simple terms, transactions arise from the policy decisions of the Government.

                    "text": "THE UNIFORM PRESENTATION FRAMEWORK - GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES/GOVERNMENT FINANCE STATISTICS (GAAP/GFS) HARMONISATION In October 2007, the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) issued a revised standard AASB 1049: Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting which governs the financial reporting of the general government sector. The objective of the revised standard is 'to achieve an Australian accounting standard for a single set of government reports which are auditable, comparable between jurisdictions, and in which the outcome statements are directly comparable with the relevant budget statements'. AASB 1049, effective from 1 July 2008 requires that, in addition to complying with all other relevant Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), the financial report for the general government sector includes key fiscal aggregates determined in a manner consistent with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) GFS manual. The new Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) was approved by Loan Council in March 2008. Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes provides the statements for the general government sector under this framework. This chapter provides additional information about sectoral financial statements for the public non-financial corporations sector and the non-financial public sector (the general government and public non-financial corporations sectors less inter-sector eliminations) plus the Loan Council Allocation table. Comprehensive operating statement The comprehensive operating statement is designed to capture the composition of revenues and expenses and the net cost of a government's activities (net result from transactions) within a financial year. As well as the full cost of resources consumed by government in achieving its objectives, and how these costs are met from various revenue sources, it also shows the impact of other economic flows affecting the net assets of the sector. The comprehensive operating statement reports three major fiscal measures: the net result from transactions (net operating balance), net lending/borrowing and total changes in net worth. The net result from transactions is calculated as revenue from transactions minus expenses from transactions. Net lending/borrowing includes net acquisition of non-financial assets from transactions but excludes depreciation, thereby giving a measure of a jurisdiction's call on financial markets. Total change in net worth is the comprehensive result from all items of income and expense recognised for the period, including other economic flows recognised in the net result as well as revaluations and other adjustments taken directly to equity. Balance sheet The balance sheet records a government's stocks of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. This statement discloses the resources over which a government has control. Major fiscal aggregates published in relation to the balance sheet include net financial worth, net financial liabilities and net debt. A description and definition of each of these aggregates is included in the glossary of terms in the preceding chapter. Cash flow statement The cash flow statement records a government's cash receipts and payments and shows how a government obtains and expends cash. The cash flow statement reports the cash surplus/deficit as a fiscal aggregate. Unlike the GFS cash flow statement, the AAS-based cash surplus/deficit excludes finance leases and similar arrangements. Statement of changes in equity The estimated statement of changes in equity presents reconciliations of each non-owner and owner equity opening balance at the beginning of the year to the closing balance at the end of the year. It also shows separately, movements due to amounts recognised in the estimated comprehensive result and amounts recognised in equity related to estimated transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.

The LCA is a measure of each government's net call on financial markets in a given financial year to meet its budget obligations. The method of public release is the responsibility of each individual jurisdiction. Victoria discloses its LCA information through the Financial Report for the State of Victoria, Budget Paper No. 4, Statement of Finances and Budget Update. Table 2.13 compares the Victorian 2010-11 LCA nomination (based on 2009-10 Budget Update estimates) approved by the Loan Council in March 2010, with the 2010-11 revised LCA based upon 2010-11 Budget estimates. Table 2.13: Loan Council Allocation ($ million) 2010-11 2010-11 Nomination Revised General government cash deficit (+)/surplus (-) 1 528.5 697.4 Public non-financial corporations sector cash deficit (+)/surplus (-) 3 162.0 3 528.5 Non-financial public sector cash deficit (+)/surplus (-) (a) 4 712.0 4 239.4 Acquisitions under finance leases and similar arrangements .. 133.3 ABS GFS cash deficit(+)/surplus(-) 4 712.0 4 372.7 Net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes (b) ( 15.0) ( 15.0) Memorandum items (c) 688.0 789.7 Loan Council Allocation 5 415.0 5 177.4 Tolerance limit (d) 944.8 944.8 Notes: (a) The sum of the surplus/deficit of the general government and public non-financial corporation sector does not directly equal the non-financial public sector surplus due to inter-sectoral transfers, which are netted out in the calculation of the non-financial public sector figure. Surplus (+)/deficit (-) excludes finance lease acquisitions. (b) The non-financial public sector surplus/deficit relating to 2010-11 includes net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes. These amounts are excluded from the surplus/deficit when calculating the LCA. (c) Memorandum items are used to adjust the ABS deficit to include in LCAs certain transactions such as operating leases, that have many of the characteristics of public sector borrowings but do not constitute formal borrowings. They are also used, where appropriate, to deduct from the ABS deficit certain transactions that Loan Council has agreed should not be included in LCAs (e.g. the over/under funding of employers' emerging costs under public sector superannuation schemes, or borrowings by entities such as statutory marketing authorities). (d) A tolerance limit equal to 2 per cent of 'total nonfinancial public sector cash receipts from operating activities' applies to jurisdictions' LCA nomination and revised LCA at budget time, and between the budget time LCA and LCA outcome. The tolerance limit applying to Victoria in 2010-11 is $944.8 million (2 per cent of $47 241.1 million - sourced from 2009-10 Budget Update ). As part of the Loan Council arrangements, the Loan Council has agreed that if at any time a jurisdiction finds that it is likely to exceed its tolerance limit, in either direction, it is required to provide an explanation to the Loan Council and, in line with the emphasis of increased transparency, to make the explanation public. Victoria's 2010-11 revised LCA of $5 177.4 million did not exceed the tolerance limit established in the LCA nomination process. In the interests of transparency, the State is required to disclose the details of infrastructure projects with private sector involvement and to report the full contingent exposure, if any. Exposure is to be measured by the Government's termination liabilities in a case of private sector default and disclosed as a footnote to, rather than a component, of LCAs. The amount payable will not exceed the fair market value of the project (which is usually calculated by an independent valuer) less any costs incurred by government as a result of the default. Listed below are details of the public private partnerships (PPP) project, that is expected to be contracted in the 2010-11 financial year. Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre project The new world-class Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre (Parkville CCC) to be built in Parkville as announced by the Government in May 2009, will bring together six clinical and research partners who will utilise the facilities, including the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne Health (which includes the Royal Melbourne Hospital), the University of Melbourne, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Royal Women's Hospital. Capital costs of the project are to be equally funded by Commonwealth and State contributions ($426.1 million each) and will be complemented by the sale of surplus land, non-government partner contributions and philanthropic donations. Under the Health and Hospitals Fund agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria, the State assumes complete and total responsibility for the delivery of the Parkville CCC with the funding contribution from the Commonwealth to be linked to procurement milestones, namely the release of the Project Brief to market and achievement of Contractual Close. The project, under the Partnerships Victoria framework, was put to market in November 2009. A private consortium will design, build, finance and maintain the Parkville CCC facilities, with responsibility for delivery of all core clinical, research and education services to be retained by the project partners. Once operations at the Parkville CCC commence, government will subsequently begin quarterly payments to the private consortium, which will be 'at risk' and dependent on attainment of key performance indicators relating to ongoing service provision. Contract execution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of the 2010-11 financial year, with the centre to be completed in 2015. The project contract will most likely include an obligation for the State to make a payment to the private consortium should the government terminate the contract for default. The quantum of the payment is not expected to exceed the remaining balance of the approved project funding at any time. There are no other Partnerships Victoria contracts greater than $5 million that involve private finance that are currently expected to be signed during the 2010-11 financial year."

                    "text": "This chapter provides financial reports for each department. The total resources made available to a department are applied to three uses: \u2022 the provision of outputs; \u2022 asset investment; or \u2022 payments on behalf of the State. The financial statements are presented in the format consistent with Australian Accounting Standards. For the purposes of this budget paper, controlled and administered items are presented in separate statements. Administered items are those resources over which a department does not exercise direct control. Authority is provided through an appropriation for payments made on behalf of the State. Under Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1050 Administered Items, these items would normally appear as notes to the department's financial statements. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables are presented to assist assessments of each department's forecast financial performance, and its use of and authority for resources: \u2022 the comprehensive operating statement provides details of the department's revenue and expenses on an accrual basis reflecting the cost of providing its outputs; \u2022 the balance sheet shows all controlled assets and liabilities of the department. The difference between these represents the net asset position, which is an indicator of the State's equity interest in the department; \u2022 the cash flow statement shows all movements of cash (cash receipts and payments). The cash impact of financing and investing activities on departmental resources is highlighted in this statement; \u2022 the statement of changes in equity adds together the net result from transactions from the operating statement and items directly recognised in equity, such as the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, to present total changes in equity; \u2022 the administered items statement provides details of the department's administered revenue and expenses, and its administered assets and liabilities. By their nature, most if not all administered items are expensed and paid in cash in the year in which the item is recognised. Thus, an administered departmental cash flow statement is not provided; \u2022 Parliamentary authority for resources provides details of the department's appropriation authorities available to fund the provision of outputs, administered items and additions to the net asset base; and \u2022 payments on behalf of the State (where applicable) provides details of payments made by a department on behalf of the State Government as a whole, not directly reflecting the operations of the department. The following Table 3.1: 'Total expenses by department' and Table 3.2: 'Purchase of non-financial assets by department' are presented as breakdowns, by department, of totals as reported in Table 1.1: Estimated operating statement and Table 1.3: Estimated cash flow statement for the general government sector in Chapter 1 (prepared in accordance with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting).

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT Operating performance The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) anticipates a positive net result from transactions of $63 million for 2010-11. The projected departmental Comprehensive result is a $45 million surplus in 2010-11 and follows an $81 million deficit forecast for 2009-10. The 2009-10 result is primarily due to the late receipt in 2008-09 of $75 million in grants for the Building the Education Revolution National School Pride (NSP) program, which meant that $63 million was expended in 2009-10. The Comprehensive Operating Statement shows an increase in total income from transactions of 4.2 per cent to $8.7 billion in 2010-11, compared to the 2009-10 revised budget of $8.3 billion. This is primarily a result of indexation and increased funding for initiatives including: \u2022 Supporting Children and Young People with a Disability or Developmental Delay; \u2022 Continued Support for Non-Government Schools; and \u2022 The National Partnership on Youth Attainment and Transitions. Total expenses from transactions for the Department in 2010-11 are budgeted at $8.6 billion, an increase of 2.6 per cent on the 2009-10 revised budget. This reflects an increase in expenses as a result of the initiatives above. Balance sheet performance The Department's net asset position is expected to increase by $1.8 billion in 2010-11 from the 2009-10 revised budget. This reflects a projected increase in total assets of $2.0 billion (13.3 per cent) and an increase in total liabilities of $185 million (10.8 per cent) over the same period. The expected increase in total assets from the 2009-10 revised budget to the 2010-11 Budget is mainly attributable to an increase in property, plant and equipment funded under the Commonwealth's and the State's continued investment under the Victorian Schools Plan to modernise, regenerate, replace existing schools, buy land and build new schools in growth areas. Investing and financing Cash flows from operating activities are consistent with the trends discussed in the operating performance. Cash flows used in investing activities include payments for non financial assets, which reflects the continued asset investment in schools through initiatives funded under the Victorian Schools Plan and the implementation of the Building the Education Revolution . Statement of administered items Total income from transactions administered by the Department on behalf of the State is forecast to decrease by $233 million in 2010-11. This is primarily due to a decrease in Commonwealth funding provided to the non-government school sector with the completion of the Building the Education Revolution and reduced funding for the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund from 2009-10 to 2010-11. Total administered items are expected to decrease in line with the anticipated decrease in administered income.

This machinery of government change effected a transfer of functions from the Department of Human Services, effective 1 October 2009. The financial statements for the Department of Health report: \u2022 2009-10 adjusted budget - a full twelve month equivalent presentation of the 2009-10 published budget for the new department; \u2022 2009-10 revised budget for the period 1 October 2009 to 30 June 2010; and \u2022 2010-11 budget for the 2010-11 year. Operating performance The Department of Health operating statement shows an increase in income of $837 million (6.9 per cent) between the 2009-10 adjusted and 2010-11 Budget . This increase is primarily a result of: \u2022 funding provided for government policy commitments announced in the 2010-11 Budget , including: Growth in Hospital Services; Support for Public Hospitals; and Home and Community Care funding, \u2022 the full year effect of initiatives announced in previous years' budgets; \u2022 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) approved funding for national health and hospitals reform; and \u2022 output price increases arising from price escalation for anticipated costs increases in 2010-11. Operating expenses are budgeted to increase by $1 130 million (9.3 per cent) between 2009-10 adjusted budget and 2010-11 Budget largely due to the increases in expenditures due to the factors outlined above, and other associated non-cash expenses. The department is expected to have a net deficit from transactions of $177 million in 2010-11. This result is primarily due to accounting for additional depreciation and amortisation expenditure as a result of revaluation of health services' buildings and other non-current physical assets, together with a reassessment of the useful lives of these assets, performed by the Victorian Valuer-General's Office. Balance sheet performance The Department's net asset position is expected to increase by $353 million between 2009-10 adjusted budget and 2010-11 Budget , reflecting an increase in total assets of $398 million and an increase in total liabilities of $45 million. The expected increase in assets reflects the Government's commitment to build new health facilities and other infrastructure across the State, based on modern service models and needs for the future. The movement in assets from 2009-10 adjusted budget to the 2010-11 Budget includes funding for: the Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre, the new Bendigo Hospital, the Box Hill Hospital redevelopment, Sunshine Hospital expansion and redevelopment - Stage 3, Olivia Newton John Cancer and Wellness Centre - Stage 2a and Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre. The expected increase in assets is also attributable to the anticipated net impact of asset revaluations in 2010-11. The expected increase in liabilities is largely due to increases in leave entitlements for staff employed in the health sector. Investing and financing Cash flows from operating activities are consistent with the trends discussed in the statement of operating performance. Cash flows from investing activities include payments for property, plant and equipment (totalling $769 million) reflecting the Government's continued asset investment in the health sector, including new initiatives to expand service capacity and enhance infrastructure. Statement of administered items This Statement includes funding from the Commonwealth Government and revenue from the sale of assets and services collected by the Department. Total income has reduced by $3 million from the 2009-10 adjusted budget to the 2010-11 Budget , primarily due to lower anticipated funding from the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) due to anticipated declining numbers of DVA cardholders.

DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES The 2010-11 financial statements for the Department of Human Services represent the new responsibilities of the department following machinery of government changes which transferred health related functions to the Department of Health, effective from 1 October 2009. Prior year results continue to include financial information of the former Department of Human Services and the 2009-10 Budget has been adjusted to reflect the comparative impact of machinery of government changes. Operating performance The Department of Human Services is projecting a net result from transactions of $5 million for 2010-11. The operating statement shows a decrease in total income from transactions of $88 million (2.5 per cent) between 2009-10 adjusted budget and 2010-11 Budget . This is primarily a result of reductions to 2010-11 revenue from the Commonwealth Government's stimulus package for social and community housing initiatives relative to the funds provided in 2009-10 Budget . However, excluding the Commonwealth Government's stimulus package reductions, revenue increases as a result of: \u2022 Funding for new initiatives announced in the 2010-11 Budget , including addressing out of home care growth, sustaining new models of care in shared supported accommodation, expanding individual support packages, strengthening capacity in family services, helping low income Victorians with the rising cost of water; and \u2022 Output price increases arising from price escalation for anticipated cost increases in 2010-11. Operating expenses are budgeted to decrease by $28 million (0.8 per cent) between 2009-10 adjusted budget and 2010-11 Budget largely due to the factors outlined above. Balance sheet performance The Department's net asset position is expected to increase by $186 million between the 2009-10 adjusted budget and 2010-11 Budget , reflecting an increase in total assets of $166 million and a decrease in total liabilities of $20 million. The expected increase in assets reflects the Government's commitment to build new community service facilities and infrastructure to meet future needs. The movement in assets from 2009-10 revised budget and 2010-11 Budget includes funding for disability reform program expanding accommodation with support. The increase in liabilities is largely due to increases of leave entitlements for staff employed in the community service sector. Investing and financing Cash flows from operating activities are consistent with the trends discussed in the statement of operating performance. Cash flows from investing activities include payments for property, plant and equipment (totalling $85 million) reflecting the Government's continued asset investment in the community services sector. Statement of administered items Transactions administered by the Department primarily relate to grants received from the Department of Justice's Victorian Housing Fund to provide additional public housing units. In addition, the Department receives minor revenue from sale of assets, goods and services.

DEPARTMENT OF INNOVATION, INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT Operating performance The Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development (DIIRD) is expected to have a net result from transactions of $37 million in 2010-11. This is a decrease of $66 million from the 2009-10 revised budget and $60 million from the initial 2009-10 Budget and is largely due to a reduction in Commonwealth grant revenue for capital projects. The Department's surplus relates primarily to the TAFE sector, driven largely by the sale of goods and services to overseas students and Commonwealth revenue for capital projects that is received as income but applied as capital expenditure, therefore appearing as an operating surplus. The operating income for DIIRD is sourced from State Government appropriations, Commonwealth grants, external revenue for education and training services provided by TAFE Institutes and other fee for service income relating to Major Projects Victoria. The total budgeted income from transactions in 2010-11 has decreased by a total of $197 million from the 2009-10 revised budget. This decrease mainly relates to a number of one-off grants received from the Commonwealth during 2009-10 for TAFE capital projects. The decrease is partly offset by additional State Government appropriations in 2010-11 for the Apprentice and Trainee Support Package, Melbourne Marketing Campaigns, and the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre. Expenses in 2010-11 have decreased by $130 million from the 2009-10 revised budget, across the grants and other transfers and other operating expenses categories. Balance sheet performance DIIRD's net asset position is expected to increase by $254 million compared to the 2009-10 revised budget. This reflects an increase in total assets relating to TAFE buildings, plant and equipment funded by the Commonwealth and State Governments and contributions from TAFE resources. In addition, other increases for new and existing capital initiatives relate to: \u2022 Melbourne Wholesale Markets redevelopment; \u2022 Melbourne Exhibition Centre expansion - Land acquisition; \u2022 TAFE institutes specialist teaching equipment; \u2022 Princes Pier Restoration Stage 2; and \u2022 Docklands Film and Television Studios - Future directions - Infrastructure enhancement. Investing and financing Cash flow from investing activities primarily reflects the purchase of property, plant and equipment from the continued asset investment in the Department and TAFE sector. These new and existing capital initiatives will assist in expanding service capacity and enhancing infrastructure. The investment activity in the 2010-11 Budget of $310 million is financed largely by a net cash inflow from operations of $99 million and a capital contribution from government of $178 million. This contribution is comprised of new investments mentioned above, in addition to asset funding announced in previous budgets. Statement of administered items The administered appropriations and expenses for 2010-11 primarily relate to lease payments associated with the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. The Department has recognised an administered liability for these lease payments and a loan receivable to the Department from the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition trust in relation to this item.

This is due to grant payments from the Victorian Property Fund for public housing and other projects being funded from prior year accumulated surpluses within the Property Fund. This is an improvement over the 2009-10 revised estimate reflecting an increase in interest revenue as the economy recovers and while interest rates are slowly improving in 2010-11 they have still not recovered to normal levels. The improvement in the deficit is also driven by one-off Victoria Police expenses funded from accumulated surplus in the 2009-10 revised budget. The 2009-10 revised budget reflects the reduction in interest rates during 2009-10 and the grant payments from the Victorian Property Fund have not reduced in line with the interest revenue. Total income in 2010-11 will increase by $317 million compared to the 2009-10 revised budget and is due to both new output initiatives announced in the 2010-11 Budget and the continued rollout of initiatives approved in earlier budgets. Expenses are estimated to increase by $279 million. The 2010-11 Budget estimate also includes escalation funding reflecting the increased cost of providing existing outputs. Major initiatives funded in the 2010-11 Budget account for the majority of the increase in appropriation revenue. These include: \u2022 $51 million for the first phase of the strategy to recruit an additional 1 700 police and the return of a further 200 police to operational roles; \u2022 $5.5 million to consolidate police call taking and dispatch in country areas which will free up 66 police to operational duties; \u2022 $24 million for Victoria Legal Aid; \u2022 $16 million for bushfire preparedness initiatives and initiatives to improve emergency response; \u2022 $10 million for increased demand in the women's prison system; \u2022 $8 million for Managing Court Demand; and \u2022 $6 million for The Better Pathways program. Estimated 2010-11 departmental operating expenses also include $31 million in additional depreciation and capital asset charge costs which flow directly from new and existing asset initiatives being funded in the 2010-11 Budget. Balance sheet performance The Department's 2010-11 net asset position is estimated to improve by $297 million compared to the 2009-10 revised budget. This comprises an estimated increase in total assets of $309 million, partially offset by an estimated increase in total liabilities of $12 million, the latter being attributable largely to movements in the value of employee entitlement provisions. Movements in property, plant and equipment reflect continued investment in the new assets across the Department in areas such as increasing prison capacity in both the men's and women's prison systems, the Victoria Police CBD Accommodation Strategy and additional funding for Victoria State Emergency Services emergency response vehicles. Investing and financing The increase in payments for property, plant and equipment in 2010-11 reflects new asset investment programs for the Justice portfolio, including major new initiatives such as increasing prison capacity in the men's and women's prison systems, the Victoria Police CBD Accommodation Strategy and additional funding for Victoria State Emergency Services emergency response vehicles. New asset investments for 2010-11 are financed by a net cash inflow from operating activities of $209 million and a capital contribution from the Government of $168 million. Statement of administered items Revenues administered by the department on behalf of the State and third parties are forecast to rise by $128 million in the 2010-11 Budget relative to the 2009-10 revised budget. Total administered expenses are forecast to increase by $129 million over the same period. Revenue from fines is expected to rise by $49 million in 2010-11 when compared with the 2009-10 revised budget. This increase is attributable to the expansion of road safety initiatives approved in previous budgets. Payments made on behalf of the State have increased relative to the 2009-10 revised budget due to the recognition of bad and doubtful debts resulting from fine related enforcement activities. Outstanding debts will continue to be vigorously pursued through all legal means however prudent accounting requires that provision be made for such debts.

This deficit results from the timing of payments from the Community Support Fund (CSF) for community projects in the 2010-11 year. The CSF itself is not in deficit. The largest component of DPCD's income is output appropriation provided by the State Government. Most of this will be applied in the provision of grants to external organisations for delivery of a range of programs. The statement also includes a portion of revenue from electronic gaming machines, which is paid into the CSF and applied to CSF programs. The estimated decrease in revenue and expenses in 2010-11 compared to 2009-10 is largely due to funding for major events which is finalised post budget. Balance sheet performance The Department's net asset position is budgeted to increase in 2010-11, largely due to budgeted investment in Central Activity Districts and sporting infrastructure. Investing and financing Payments for property, plant and equipment for the 2010-11 Budget year are budgeted at $112 million, and relate to DPCD's existing capital investment program and new capital investment initiatives announced as part of the 2010-11 Budget . The increase in the net cash inflow from financing activities in the 2010-11 Budget reflects the increase in capital funding of existing projects as well as new initiatives as part of the 2010-11 Budget . Statement of administered items Transactions administered by DPCD on behalf of the State include: \u2022 Commonwealth payments to local government; and \u2022 ANZAC Day racing proceeds.

Overall, DPC's income estimates for 2010-11 reflect a $30 million decrease compared with the 2009-10 revised budget. This decrease results mainly from a decrease in operating funding provided by government, reflecting the downscaling of operations of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority. This is partially offset by additional funding for new output initiatives, including: \u2022 Cultural Precincts and community infrastructure fund; and \u2022 Sustaining the State Library of Victoria. The expenditure decrease ($27 million) is primarily due to the fact that the expenditure for the aforementioned bushfire related activities will be $28 million less in 2010-11 and the inclusion in 2009-10 of a one-off transition grant paid to the Department of Health ($5 million). These decreases will be partially offset by expenditure in 2010-11 related to the new initiatives mentioned above. Balance sheet performance The Department's net asset position in 2010-11 is estimated to increase by $82 million compared with the 2009-10 revised budget, principally as a result of: \u2022 an increase in other financial assets largely representing appropriation received for depreciation not being fully drawn down in cash; \u2022 an increase in property, plant and equipment primarily associated with the Southbank Cultural Precinct Redevelopment; and \u2022 an increase in financial assets of the National Gallery of Victoria, following the temporary investment of donations received. Investing and financing The cash flow statement shows an increase of $25 million in payments for non-financial assets by the Department between the 2009-10 revised budget and the 2010-11 Budget. This is primarily as a result of the Department's only significant capital project in 2010-11, the Southbank Cultural Precinct Redevelopment. Statement of administered items The administered items statement shows a decrease in the net result of $15 million. This is related to the conduct of the Royal Commission into the 2009 Victorian bushfires. A total of $40 million is appropriated as revenue in 2009-10, with expenditure occurring over 2008-09, 2009-10, and 2010-11.

This budgeted deficit is due to the planned use of prior years' accumulated cash balances. Most of DPI's operating income is sourced from State Government appropriations and supplemented by external funding predominantly received for scientific research and extension projects. The total income from transactions for the 2010-11 Budget is expected to be $510 million, a $37 million reduction from the 2009-10 revised budget. This decrease primarily relates to the reduction in estimates for the Exceptional Circumstances Interest Rate Subsidy (ECIRS) drought assistance program in Victoria as assistance is no longer extended to the South and West Gippsland area after 30 April 2010 and the South Western area after 31 March 2010. The reduction is also attributable to a lower amount of budget brought forward into 2010-11 compared to the budget brought forward into 2009-10. This is a consequence of expenditure being more accurately aligned with the budget cash flows. The decrease in operating expenses from $556 million in 2009-10 revised budget to $511 million in 2010-11 Budget relates to additional 2009-10 funding for the Victorian Government's drought initiatives undertaken in 2009-10 and the reduction in the number of areas in Victoria declared as areas of exeptional circumstances, which lowers expenditure estimates for the ECIRS drought assistance program. Balance sheet performance DPI's net asset position is expected to increase from $342 million in the 2009-10 revised budget to $364 million in the 2010-11 Budget. This increase is mainly due to commitments to improving Victoria's scientific infrastructure through the Biosciences Research Centre project. The decrease in net assets of $191 million from the 2009-10 Budget to the 2010-11 Budget is due to the transfer of responsibility of the Melbourne Wholesale Markets redevelopment project to the Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development and the cash flow adjustment of the Biosciences Research Centre project to reflect the Partnerships Victoria framework. Investing and financing The increase in cash flows for investing activities from $11 million in the 2009-10 revised budget to $27 million in the 2010-11 Budget is mainly due to contributions towards the Biosciences Research Centre project, an investment in a new world-class facility for agricultural biosciences research and development. In addition, upgrading advanced computing for biological and farm systems research contributes to the increase in investing activities in 2010-11. The increase in cash flow from financing activities also reflects the Government's contribution to the Biosciences Research Centre project being developed at the La Trobe University's Bundoora campus and the development of advanced computing for biological and farm systems research. Statement of administered items Administered income is expected to decrease from $121 million in the 2009-10 revised budget to $109 million in the 2010-11 Budget as a result of lower estimates in revenue received from external parties for research activities. However a further $7 million of research contracts are pending contract finalisation, which will increase administered income accordingly. Administered expenses in 2009-10 revised budget is higher than 2010-11 Budget by $35 million mainly related to the 2009-10 transfer of Victorian Energy Networks Corporation (VENCorp) assets at net market value free-of-charge to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

The expected deficit forecast for 2010-11 is attributable to the planned use of prior year accumulated trust fund monies. Total income from transactions in 2010-11 is expected to decrease by $111 million compared to the 2009-10 revised budget. This is due to a combination of the completion of a range of initiatives in 2009-10, $17 million in further savings and efficiencies planned to be achieved from 2010-11 and non recurring funding provided in 2009-10. Non-recurring funding includes $77 million in Treasurer's Advance funding offset by $54 million in 2009-10 appropriation funding carried forward into 2010-11 and funding of new initiatives to commence in the 2010-11 Budget . The major components of Treasurer's Advance funding being provided in 2009-10 are $57.0 million for fire preparedness activities in light of Victoria's severe 2009-10 fire season which includes funding for programs approved via the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, $9 million in additional water rate rebates for farmers as part of the Government's 2009 drought response package and $6.9 million for additional solar hot water rebates in regional Victoria. Total expenses from transactions in 2010-11 is expected to decrease by $97 million compared to the 2009-10 revised budget as a result of these same factors. Total other economic flows included in the net result forecast for 2009-10 include asset write-off of $20 million for parks assets. Balance sheet performance DSE's 2010-11 net asset position is estimated to improve by $66 million. This comprises of an estimated increase in total assets of $70 million offset by an estimated increase in total liabilities of $4 million. Financial assets are expected to increase by $20 million by 30 June 2011 and non-financial assets by $51 million. Major new capital initiatives commencing in the 2010-11 Budget : \u2022 Asset replacement and renewal at Victoria's parks and public land: $7.1 million ($11.2 million over two years); \u2022 Grasslands Reserves to protect endangered species: $10 million in 2010-11; and \u2022 Hume Dam - Southern Training Wall Remedial Works: $3.5 million ($10.5 million over three years). Investing and financing DSE's net cash position is forecast to reduce by $11 million in 2010-11 Budget resulting from a net cash flow from operating activities of $39 million and an equity contribution from Government of $94 million offset by a net cash outflow in investing activities of $124 million and an increase of $20 million in borrowings. The equity contribution from Government provides the additional funding required to finance the Department's asset investment program which is not generated from cash flows arising from operating activities. Statement of administered items Expenses administered by DSE on behalf of the State relate to Victoria's share of agreed cost sharing arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth for the Murray Darling Basin Authority for the management of water flows. Amounts shown as grants and other transfers also form part of this arrangement. Administered income other than Commonwealth grants represents the collection of fees and charges for land title transactions, environmental levy contributions, Crown land leases and licences and forest royalties. Commonwealth funding reflected as grants and other income covers a range of Commonwealth own purpose payments including the National Water Initiative, Purchase of Grasslands as well as payments to be distributed under the Commonwealth Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.

This is primarily due to the funding for Commonwealth road projects being receipted as operating income but applied as asset investments. Total income from transactions is expected to increase by $490 million (9.2 per cent) in 2010-11 compared with the 2009-10 revised budget. This increase is largely the result of: \u2022 new output initiatives for 2010-11 including Victorian Transport Plan initiatives; \u2022 additional funding from the State Government to meet contracted service payments, primarily in the areas of public transport and road services, including the full effect of initiatives approved in prior years; \u2022 funding from the Commonwealth Government for road projects under the Nation Building (AusLink II) Program; \u2022 changes to the arrangements for public transport fare revenue. Under the new franchise agreements which commenced on 30 November 2009, all fare revenue is received by the State and then paid to rail operators. Under the previous franchise agreements, the rail operators received fare revenue directly; \u2022 increases in the capital charge relating to investments in rail assets reflecting net assets held by VicTrack; and \u2022 the transfer of responsibility for local ports from the Department of Sustainability and Environment in 2010-11. Expenses from transactions are estimated to increase by $349 million (6.7 per cent) in 2010-11. The additional expenditure in 2010-11 reflects the increased funding provided for public transport and road services, capital charge and the change to the arrangements for public transport fare revenue outlined above. Balance sheet performance The Department's net assets are budgeted to increase by $634 million from the 2009-10 revised budget to the 2010-11 Budget. Major movements in total assets include the impact of the construction of new roads and other infrastructure. Investing and financing Cash flows from operating activities are consistent with the trends discussed above. The expected investments in new property, plant and equipment in 2010-11 reflect approved cash flows for existing and new road asset initiatives announced in the 2010-11 Budget . New initiatives including: \u2022 the construction of Geelong Ring Road Stage 4C with funding totalling $77 million total estimated investment (TEI); \u2022 the Outer Suburban Arterial Roads program totalling $66 million TEI; \u2022 the Better Roads - Regional Victoria Development Package totalling $52 million TEI and; \u2022 Nation Building (AusLink II) Program with projects totalling $231 million TEI. Rail infrastructure investment is recorded in the balance sheet of VicTrack. In 2010-11, new rail initiatives include: \u2022 Regional Rail Link with funding in partnership with the Commonwealth Government of $4.3 billion TEI; \u2022 Tram Procurements and Supporting Infrastructure with funding of $805 million TEI and; \u2022 Melbourne Metro with funding of $40 million TEI. Statement of administered items Transactions administered by the Department of Transport on behalf of the State include the collection of road and public transport regulatory fees and fines revenues. Revenue received from the Commonwealth for road and rail projects is also included in 2008-09. The 2010-11 Budget also includes the progressive recognition of concession fees paid in advance by Transurban under the CityLink contract. Total administered income is budgeted to increase in 2010-11 by $88 million from the 2009-10 revised budget. This largely reflects additional taxation revenue and the release of new taxi licenses as part of the Government's response to the Essential Services Commission's Taxi Fare Review 2007-08. Administered payments are likewise affected by the items outlined above.

This is an increase of $23 million from the 2009-10 revised budget. The Department's revenue for output delivery and corresponding budgeted expenses is expected to decrease from $287 million to $235 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to: \u2022 reduction of $26 million in operating funding required to implement the next stage of the standardisation of core information technology services; \u2022 reduction of $5 million in funding required for implementation of the final stage of the Commonwealth's Seamless National Economy National Partnership project; \u2022 funding reduction which reflects lower amortisation costs of $8 million for municipal land valuations; and \u2022 reduction in capital asset charge of $6 million for land and buildings. Revenue from sales of goods and services (and corresponding underlying expenditure) is expected to increase by $24 million, principally representing the impact of more departments now being serviced by the centralised information technology provider. The decrease in other income between 2009-10 published and revised budgets was mainly associated with a one-off transfer of accumulated rental income from government-owned buildings to the Consolidated Fund ($17 million). This was also the principal cause of the net deficit result from transactions. Balance sheet performance Controlled net assets of the department are budgeted to increase by $29 million between 2009-10 revised budget and 2010-11 Budget . Non-financial assets will increase by $42 million, resulting from the purchase of municipal land valuations and information technology equipment, in addition to building projects to improve energy performance at government-owned buildings across Melbourne and regional Victoria. The increase in liabilities of $9 million includes the repayable advance provided for the building projects. Investing and financing The Department's 2010-11 budgeted net cash flows from operating activities is $16 million higher than the 2009-10 revised budget, largely due to the $17 million transfer payment of rental income into the Consolidated Fund occurring in 2009-10. Statement of administered items A large number of transactions are managed on behalf of the State, for which the Department does not exercise direct control, for example, the collection of State taxation income and administration of the State's superannuation expenses. Total administered income is estimated to increase by $3 903 million between the 2009-10 revised budget and the 2010-11 Budget . The $957 million increase in other income is primarily associated with the areas of general own-source revenue such as taxation and dividends. The increase of $740 million in grants is due to the net effect of a $998 million increase in GST-related Commonwealth Grants, and a $258 million decrease in Council of Australian Governments (COAG) related aggregate payments, covering most Specific Purpose and National Partnership payments for Victoria. Total special appropriations are estimated to increase by $1 515 million, providing the Department with the authority to make payments for maturing loans as part of managing the State's debt. Total administered operating expenses are estimated to increase by $3 642 million, largely reflecting the increase in revenue receipts that are required to be transferred to the Consolidated Fund. Grants and other transfers are estimated to increase by $2 928 million between 2009-10 budget and 2009-10 revised budget, mainly due to increased transfer payments of COAG related funding to non-government schools. Total other economic flows for the 2009-10 revised budget is estimated to be $1 229 million. The State's superannuation liability is estimated to decrease by $400 million primarily due to higher than expected investment returns on superannuation assets. In addition, the improvement in the aluminium market is estimated to result in a $414 million decrease in liabilities. This is in respect of the State fully indemnifying the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for the electricity supply agreements with the aluminium smelters.

The operating statement shows an increase in total operating income of $10 million (or 6 per cent) from the 2009-10 revised budget to the 2010-11 Budget . The increase in annual appropriation revenue is due to additional output appropriations from the Government, including funding for $1.3 million increased operating costs for VAGO. VAGO will continue to access a receipt retention agreement under Section 29 of the Financial Management Act 1994 to meet costs associated with the output Audit Reports on Financial Statements. Balance sheet performance The net asset position in 2010-11 will have a movement of $2 million from the 2009-10 revised budget due to the continuation of Parliament's capital program. Investing and financing Cash flow from financing activities are expected to increase in 2010-11 compared to 2009-10 as asset investment is increased. Statement of administered items VAGO administers certain resources on behalf of the State. These resources predominantly comprise financial statement audit fees collected from audited agencies under the authority of the Audit Act 1994 .

                    "text": "SUMMARY OF GENERAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE This chapter describes the major categories of revenue comprising both state sourced revenue and Commonwealth Government grants, and examines the expected movement in revenue between the 2009-10 revised estimates and the 2010-11 Budget estimates. Total revenue comprises revenue from transactions and revenue from economic flows. Revenue from transactions represents the majority of total revenue in the 2010-11 Budget estimates and is the focus of discussion in this chapter. As shown in Table 4.1, general government sector revenue is expected to increase by 4.6 per cent in 2010-11 to $45 759 million. Table 4.1: General government sector revenue and grants received ($ million) 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Change Actual Revised Budget % (a) Taxation 12 626.9 13 642.1 14 437.8 5.8 Interest 378.2 348.5 358.0 2.7 Dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue 490.4 459.2 504.9 10.0 Sales of goods and services 4 940.5 5 427.9 5 847.4 7.7 Grants received 18 970.0 22 111.3 22 893.1 3.5 Other current revenue 1 878.9 1 756.5 1 718.0 -2.2 Total revenue from transactions 39 284.8 43 745.5 45 759.3 4.6 Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Note: (a) Per cent change between 2009-10 and 2010-11. Taxation revenue in 2010-11 is expected to be $14 438 million, an increase of $796 million or 5.8 per cent on the 2009-10 revised estimate. This increase primarily reflects: \u2022 growth in payroll tax revenue consistent with the continuing recovery in the labour market, partially offset by the reduction in the payroll tax rate to 4.90 per cent from 1 July 2010; \u2022 continuing growth in land transfer duty reflecting the strength in the property market despite recent monetary tightening and an easing in first home owner demand; \u2022 growth in land tax revenue as a result of increased property values; \u2022 an increase in gambling tax revenue in line with expected growth in household consumption expenditure, and the impact of changes to Crown Casino's licence conditions; and \u2022 increased revenue from taxes on insurance reflecting an expected increase in non-life insurance revenue due to premium rate increases and growth in the economy. Interest revenue is estimated to be $358 million in 2010-11, $9 million or 2.7 per cent higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate. Dividend, income tax and rate equivalent revenue is expected to be $505 million in 2010-11, an increase of 10.0 per cent on the 2009-10 revised estimate. This mainly reflects an increase in dividend revenue from the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) following a decision in 2009-10 not to take a dividend as a result of challenging financial conditions. Sales of goods and services revenue is expected to increase by 7.7 per cent in 2010-11 to $5 847 million primarily reflecting increases in revenue from the provision of services and regulatory fees as well as a smaller increase in capital asset charge revenue. Total grants revenue is estimated to increase by $782 million or 3.5 per cent to $22 893 million in 2010-11. This is largely due to an increase in goods and services tax (GST) grants, partly offset by a decline in grants for specific purposes primarily driven by the wind back built into the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan . Other current revenue is expected to be $1 718 million, or $38 million (2.2 per cent) lower than the 2009-10 revised estimate. This is mainly due to declines in fair value of assets received free of charge or for nominal consideration and donations and gifts, partly offset by increases in fines and other miscellaneous income.

This reflects the recent strength in the property market, continued economic and population growth and other factors such as increases in insurance premiums.

(c) 'Franchise taxes' category of Note 2 of Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements. Payroll tax Payroll tax is levied on taxable Victorian wages, which are defined to include salaries and wages, commissions, bonuses, taxable fringe benefits, and payments to some contractors. Payroll tax of 4.95 per cent is currently levied on businesses with a taxable total wage bill above an annual tax free threshold of $550 000. As part of measures introduced in this budget, the payroll tax rate is scheduled to decrease to 4.90 per cent, effective from 1 July 2010. This represents the 7th rate reduction of this government. Around 31 000 businesses in Victoria will benefit from the cuts to the payroll tax rate. Victorian businesses operating with payrolls valued between $5.5 million to $17.95 million will pay the lowest payroll tax in Australia. Since 1 July 2007, Victoria and NSW have led the nation in harmonising payroll tax legislation including common definitions and exemptions (excluding rates and thresholds), to streamline administration and reduce compliance costs for businesses. Tasmania, South Australia and recently, the Northern Territory have since joined with Victoria and NSW to harmonise their legislation, with other jurisdictions set to follow with respect to eight main provisions of the law. All jurisdictions have commenced the process of harmonising administrative arrangements, such as developing common revenue rulings. Thirty-six joint Victorian and NSW revenue office revenue rulings have been published in the period to March 2010, most of which have now been adopted by Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The Payroll Tax Harmonisation Committee established by all the jurisdictions in Australia, to oversee the design, implementation and maintenance of an administrative framework has established key draft protocols designed to assist revenue offices by articulating processes to ensure taxpayers who employ people across jurisdictions are dealt with consistently and without the need to repeat basic interactions with multiple offices. In 2010-11 payroll tax revenue is estimated to be $4 259 million, an increase of $236 million (5.9 per cent) over the 2009-10 revised estimate. This growth reflects increasing employment and wages, as well as an expected recovery in average hours worked per employee, moderated by the reduction in the payroll tax rate. Taxes on property Land tax Land tax is an annual tax assessed on the aggregated taxable value of all land owned by a landowner in Victoria. In 2010-11, more than $2 billion worth of exemptions, including land used for charitable purposes, land used for primary production, and land that is used as the principal place of residence of the owner will be provided by the government (see Chapter 5 Tax Expenditures and Concessions for more details). In this budget, the Government has extended the current land tax exemption for retirement villages, residential care facilities, supported residential services and residential services for people with disabilities to include the construction phase of these facilities for a maximum construction period of two years, with a view to reduce construction costs and encourage private investment in the sector. Table 4.3 shows the land tax rates that are applicable for the 2011 land tax year (being the 2010-11 Budget year).

For landholdings valued at over $3 million, the surcharge is zero and the general marginal rate applies. Land tax revenue is expected to be $1 362 million in 2010-11, above the 2009-10 revised estimate of $1 219 million. This reflects the expected increase in land values for the two years to 1 January 2010, as well as the progressiveness in the land tax scales. Legislation requires that valuations be conducted biennially: the 2010 valuations will be used for both the 2011 and 2012 land tax years. Land tax on trusts Certain trusts are subject to a land tax surcharge of 0.375 per cent (on top of the ordinary land tax rates). The surcharge is phased out for site values between $1.8 million and $3.0 million to ensure that the rate on trusts is the same as standard land tax rates on land values above $3.0 million. Congestion levy The congestion levy is an annual charge on owners of long stay off street car parking spaces in Melbourne's Central Business District and adjacent areas such as Southbank, Docklands and the St Kilda Road precinct. The levy is subject to indexation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and for 2010 is $860 per car parking space. An exception is the area bounded by Montague Street, the West Gate Freeway, CityLink and the Yarra River for which the levy is currently set at $400 pending the outcome of the Government's review of parking requirements in planning schemes. Various car parking spaces are exempt from the levy, including short stay parking spaces so as not to inhibit retail trade within the boundaries, parking spaces used exclusively for residential purposes, and certain other parking spaces such as those used by ambulances and charitable institutions. Congestion levy revenue in 2010-11 is expected to be $46 million, 2.1 per cent higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate mainly due to CPI indexation. In line with the Government's commitment to review the effectiveness of the levy, the Government has asked the Department of Treasury and Finance to undertake a review of the levy. The objectives of the review are to gauge the levy's contribution to congestion management and to assess progress on streamlining its administration. Land transfer duty Duty is payable on any transaction that results in a change of beneficial ownership of land and associated real assets. Properties bought as a principal place of residence attract a lower marginal rate for certain dutiable values. The rates of conveyancing duty are shown in Table 4.4. Table 4.4: Duty on land transfers General land transfer duty rates Value of property transferred Duty payable $0 to $25 000 $25 001 to $130 000 $130 001 to $960 000 $960 001 and over 1.4% of the value of the property $350 plus 2.4% of the value in excess of $25 000 $2 870 plus 6% of the value in excess of $130 000 5.5% of the value of the property Land transfer duty rates for principal place of residence purchases Value of property transferred Duty payable $0 to $25 000 $25 001 to $130 000 $130 001 to $440 000 $440 001 to $550 000 $550 001 to $960 000 $960 001 and over 1.4% of the value of the property $350 plus 2.4% of the value in excess of $25 000 $2 870 plus 5% of the value in excess of $130 000 $18 370 plus 6% of the value in excess of $440 000 $28 070 plus 6% of the value in excess of $550 000 5.5% of the value of the property Source: Duties Act 2000 There is a land transfer duty exemption for homes transferred into special disability trusts in recognition of the particular nature of the arrangements for persons with a severe disability. There is also a full duty concession on property purchases of not more than $330 000 for concession cardholders with a partial concession available for property worth not more than $440 000. Land transfer duty revenue is expected to increase by $174 million or 5.0 per cent in 2010-11, following an estimated 25 per cent increase in land transfer revenue in 2009-10. After a trough due to the global downturn in 2008-09, the property market rebounded, in part due to the Commonwealth Government's First Home Owner Boost and the Victorian Government's First Home Bonus , and declines in mortgage interest rates. The recovery in the economy has provided further support to the market. The property market remains strong despite recent monetary tightening and the easing of the first home owner demand. Recent market activity, as reported by the Real Estate Institute of Victoria and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is showing continuing strong sales and prices. The Government's First Home Bonus provides targeted relief to Victorian's entering the housing market for the first time. Other property duties This category includes revenue from minor duties such as duty on declarations of trust over property other than land, which is currently set at $200, and duty on the sale of certain livestock, with revenue directed to a trust fund relating to disease control. This revenue also includes any minor adjustment amounts relating to property taxes that have been abolished in recent years. Revenue from other property duties is estimated to be $8.6 million in 2010-11, unchanged from the revised 2009-10 estimate. Metropolitan improvement levy The rate of the levy is set each year with regard to expected disbursements from the Parks and Reserves Trust Account, taking into account the inflation rate. The revenue is earmarked by the Department of Sustainability and Environment for expenditure on metropolitan parks, gardens and waterways. Revenue in 2010-11 is estimated to be $125 million or $3.8 million (3.1 per cent) higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate due to both annual indexation of the levy and an increase in the number of properties in the metropolitan area. Property owners contributions to fire brigades Municipal councils whose districts are within or partly within the metropolitan area serviced by the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board are collectively required by legislation to contribute 12.5 per cent of the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board's approved annual budget. Revenue in 2010-11 is expected to be $36 million, $1.5 million (4.4 per cent) higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate, which reflects continued investment in the state's urban fire services. Financial accommodation levy The financial accommodation levy (FAL) applies to government owned entities declared to be leviable authorities for the purposes of the Financial Management Act 1994 . The purpose of the levy is to remove the competitive advantage that government entities may experience in borrowing, and is consistent with the competitive neutrality principles as prescribed by the National Competition Policy framework. The FAL in 2010-11 is expected to be $80 million, higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate of $53 million. This increase is mainly due to the expected increase in borrowings by water corporations to fund capital projects. Gambling taxes Gambling taxes are imposed on public lotteries, electronic gaming machines (EGMs), the casino, racing, and some other minor forms of gambling. The taxes are typically in the form of a percentage of net expenditure, with the tax rate varying by category of gambling. Net expenditure is equal to the amount gambled less prizes or refunds to players. In the case of EGMs, there is also an annual health benefit levy of $4 333 per machine in operation. Most government revenue from these forms of gambling is transferred by standing appropriation to one of the Hospitals and Charities Fund, the Mental Health Fund, the Community Support Fund. In 2010-11, it is estimated that 82 per cent ($1 419 million) of total gambling taxation revenue will be transferred by standing appropriation to these funds. Overall gambling taxes are expected to increase by 4.0 per cent ($67 million) in 2010-11, compared with the 2009-10 revised estimate. This is in line with household consumption expenditure growth and the impact of changes to Crown Casino's licence conditions, including a progressive increase in the tax rate on the Casino's gaming machines (which commenced on 1 January 2010) and changes to table game arrangements. From August 2012, the tax applying to wagering will be reduced to support the post 2012 licensing arrangements and provide the Victorian racing industry with additional funding from wagering. The Government will also introduce a new progressive tax system for EGMs post 2012 applying to each venue's average monthly per gaming machine net expenditure. Levies on statutory corporations Water corporations are required to pay an annual environmental contribution to fund water related initiatives that seek to promote the sustainable management of water, and to improve environmental performance. The environmental contribution levy was extended for a further four years from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012, and is estimated to raise an additional $295 million over this period (compared to an estimated $227 million over the four years to 30 June 2008). A decision on whether to continue the environmental contribution levy beyond this four year period has not been made to date and will be subject to the process set out in the Water Industry Act 1994 . Taxes on insurance Non life insurance Duty is payable on the gross value of premiums on general insurance business at a rate of 10 per cent. General insurance is any sort of insurance that is applicable to property in Victoria, a risk, contingency or event that may occur within, or partly in Victoria, or both. Motor, home and contents insurance are examples of general insurance. The definition includes insurance in respect of trauma and disabilities but it excludes health insurance, life insurance and compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance. Exemptions from payment of this duty relate to policies against damage by hail to cereal and fruit crops, workers' compensation premiums, commercial marine hull insurance, private guarantee fidelity insurance schemes, insurance businesses carried on by organisations registered under Part VI of the Commonwealth National Health Act 1953 and transport insurance policies. Reinsurance policies are not dutiable. Non-life insurance revenue is expected to increase by $62 million (8.5 per cent) in 2010-11 compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate. This mainly reflects an expected increase in non-life insurance premium rates, consistent with industry expectations, and growth in the economy. Life insurance Life insurance is any insurance or assurance in respect of life or lives, or an event or contingency relating to or depending on a life or lives, of persons domiciled in Victoria. Temporary or term life insurance is taxed once at the 5 per cent rate upon commencement of the policy. For whole of life insurance, duty is payable on the sum insured. Life insurance revenue is expected to rise by $0.2 million (3.9 per cent) compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate broadly in line with the expected growth in the economy. Duty on compulsory third party premiums Duty is payable on the value of compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance premiums at a rate of 10 per cent. Compulsory third party premium revenue is expected to increase by $6.1 million (4.3 per cent) compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate. This reflects an anticipated rise in the volume of motor vehicle registrations, as well as indexation in line with the CPI. Insurance contributions to fire brigades Victoria partly funds fire services through an insurance based funding model. Insurance companies generally choose to recover their contributions through an insurance industry fire services levy imposed on premiums from policyholders. The level of required contributions by insurance companies to the approved annual budget of the Victorian fire services is prescribed under Section 37 of the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Act 1958 (75.0 per cent) and Section 76 of the Country Fire Authority Act 1958 (77.5 per cent). The legislation also prescribes that non-residential property owners who choose to either self insure or insure off-shore, are required to pay a contribution to whichever fire service covers the area in which their property is located. In 2010-11, revenue from insurance contributions to fire services is anticipated to increase by $9 million (1.8 per cent) compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate and reflects a slight increase to the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board's expected insurance contribution, including indexation. There is no expected change to insurance industry contributions to the Country Fire Authority. The government is undertaking a review of the fire services levy as part of the commitment to release a White Paper by February 2010. Motor vehicle taxes Motor vehicle taxes include registration fees and motor vehicle duty. Vehicle registration fees Motor vehicle registration fees are fees charged upon the registration of a vehicle and vary according to vehicle type and use of the vehicle. Pensioner and health care cardholders receive a 50 per cent concession on their motor vehicle registration fee while Department of Veteran Affairs gold cardholders receive a 100 per cent reduction on their motor vehicle registration fee. Duty on vehicle registrations and transfer Duty is levied on the transfer and registration of motor vehicles, motorcycles and trailers in Victoria. The duty is levied on the market value or purchase price (whichever is greater) of the vehicle, at a progressive rate on new passenger cars, and at a flat rate for other vehicles. Victoria currently has the lowest stamp duty on new conventionally powered passenger cars up to $57 009 of the major states, which includes most common Australian made family cars. The rate scale is shown in Table 4.5. Table 4.5: Motor vehicle duty rates Market value of vehicle Duty payable For motor vehicles not previously registered: Passenger cars $ 0 - $ 57 009 (a) $5.00 per $200 or part thereof on entire price $ 57 010 (a) or more $10.00 per $200 or part thereof on entire price Other vehicles All values $5.00 per $200 or part thereof on entire price For motor vehicles previously registered, regardless of where: All values $8.00 per $200 or part thereof on entire price Source: Duties Act 2000 Note: (a) From 1 July 2010, this threshold will be aligned with Commonwealth luxury car tax threshold, which is currently $57 180 and indexed annually. Aggregate motor vehicle taxation revenue in 2010-11 is expected to grow by $41 million (2.9 per cent) compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate. Of this, registration fee revenue is forecast to increase by $44 million (5.2 per cent) in 2010-11, as a result of an expected increase in registration volumes principally driven by household and population growth, increasing motor vehicle ownership, as well as growth in motor vehicle registration fees in line with the CPI. Revenue from duty on motor vehicle registrations and transfers is expected to decrease by $2.1 million (down 0.4 per cent) in 2010-11 compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate, mainly due to movements in interest rates, and the ending of the Commonwealth's small and general business tax break on 31 December 2009. Other taxes This category includes the landfill levy, which is aimed at reducing the volume of non recyclable waste disposed at Victorian landfills, concession fees paid in advance by Transurban with respect to Melbourne CityLink, which are progressively recognised as income, and liquor licence fees. Landfill revenue is expected to increase by 48.3 per cent in 2010-11 to $68 million. In March 2010, the Government announced two initial increases to landfill levy rates and further progressive increases over the following four years to 2014-15. These increases recognise that incentives are needed to reduce the level of waste and to stimulate the recycling industry and encourage new recycling technologies. Interest revenue Interest revenue is estimated to be $358 million in 2010-11, $9 million or 2.7 per cent higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate. Changes in interest revenue reflect movements in cash balances held by general government entities and changes in interest rates on those balances. Dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue This category of revenue comprises dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue received by the State from government business enterprises as detailed in Table 4.6. Table 4.6: Dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue ($ million) 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Change Actual Revised Budget % (a) Dividends 344.6 307.8 340.8 10.7 Income tax equivalent revenue 141.2 146.7 159.1 8.4 Local government rate equivalent revenue 4.5 4.6 5.1 9.8 Total dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue 490.4 459.2 504.9 10.0 Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Note: (a) Per cent change between 2009-10 and 2010-11. Dividend, income tax and rate equivalent revenue is expected to be $505 million in 2010-11, which is $46 million (10.0 per cent) higher than the 2009-10 revised estimate, mainly driven by higher dividend revenue. Total dividend revenue is expected to increase by $33 million (10.7 per cent) in 2010-11. This is largely due to an increase in dividend revenue from the TAC following a decision in 2009-10 not to take a dividend as a result of challenging financial conditions. Total income tax equivalent revenue is expected to increase by $12 million (8.4 per cent) in 2010-11, mainly as a result of higher forecast profits for the metropolitan water sector. Sales of goods and services As reported in Table 4.1, revenue from sales of goods and services is estimated to be $5 847 million in 2010-11, an increase of 7.7 per cent or $419 million on the 2009-10 revised estimate. Factors contributing to this change include: \u2022 an increase in revenue from farebox collections under new rail contracts which came into operation on 30 November 2009; \u2022 an increase in inter-sector capital asset charge revenue from VicTrack reflecting increased VicTrack asset values due to additional capital expenditure; \u2022 increased third party revenue in the health sector and ambulance services; \u2022 increases in TAFE institutes fee revenue from both international and domestic students; and \u2022 increases in a range of other fees and charges broadly in line with increases in the CPI. Note 4 of the Estimated Financial Statements, Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes , provides a breakdown of sales of goods and services by major category. Other current revenue Other current revenue includes the fair value of assets received free of charge, fines, royalties, donations and gifts and other miscellaneous income. These are shown in Table 4.7. Table 4.7: Other current revenue ($ million) 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 Change Actual Revised Budget % (a) Fair value of assets received free of charge or for nominal consideration 131.3 109.6 1.0 -99.1 Traffic camera and on the spot fines 381.4 437.2 476.8 9.1 Other fines 89.1 72.2 82.6 14.4 Total Fines 470.5 509.4 559.4 9.8 Royalties 48.1 47.8 46.2 -3.2 Donations and gifts 269.3 271.4 233.9 -13.8 Other non-property rental 23.8 21.6 21.7 0.5 Other miscellaneous income 936.0 796.8 855.9 7.4 Other current revenue 1 878.9 1 756.5 1 718.0 -2.2 Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Note: (a) Per cent change between 2009-10 and 2010-11. In 2010-11 other current revenue is expected to be $1 718 million, or $38 million (2.2 per cent) lower than the 2009-10 revised estimate. This is mainly due to a decrease in fair value of assets received free of charge or for nominal consideration and donations and gifts, partly offset by increases in fines and other miscellaneous income. The decline in revenue from fair value of assets received free of charge or for nominal consideration represents one-off transactions such as transfers of land, which are lower in aggregate in 2010-11 than the 2009-10 revised estimate. Other miscellaneous income is expected to increase by $59 million or 7.4 per cent to $856 million in 2010-11, partly due to an increase in taxi license revenue from increased sales of taxi license plates to put more taxis on the road. The 2010-11 fines estimate of $559 million has been revised down from last year's budget estimate of $581.5 million for 2010-11, which can partially be attributed to improved driver behaviour. Fines revenue is expected to increase by $50 million or 9.8 per cent to $559 million in 2010-11 compared to 2009-10 revised budget. This increase includes additional revenue from the ongoing implementation of expanded road safety initiatives as part of arrive alive 2 . The Government has invested in a number of road safety initiatives, including expansion of the fixed digital road safety camera network, enhanced enforcement of speed restrictions, increasing the use of moving mode radar technology, additional drug and alcohol testing, tougher sanctions within the reissuing of the road regulations in November 2009 and extending the vehicle impoundment scheme. These initiatives will assist in reducing the impact of road trauma on the community, as set out in Victoria's road safety strategy, arrive alive 2 . Receipts collected from traffic camera and on the spot speeding fines have been channelled into improving Victoria's roads through Better Roads Victoria. This initiative establishes a transparent link between traffic fines and the Government's expenditure on roads, road safety and road maintenance programs. GRANTS Summary information on the estimates for the various grant categories for the 2009-10 revised estimate and the 2010-11 Budget estimate are shown in Table 4.8. The detailed estimates provided in this chapter represent the latest information available to the Victorian Government at the time of finalisation of the 2010-11 Budget .

Total grants are expected to increase by 3.5 per cent between 2009-10 and 2010-11 reflecting a 9.8 per cent increase in general purpose grants (GST). However, GST revenue in 2010-11 is expected to remain over $500 million below what was projected in the 2008-09 Budget . The increase in GST revenue in 2010-11 is partly offset by a decline in grants for specific purposes of 1.2 per cent. Specific purpose grants for on passing are also forecast to decrease by $94 million or 3.3 per cent in 2010-11. General purpose grants In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations , agreed to in 2008, the states and territories currently receive all GST revenue. From 2011-12 an amount of GST revenue will be dedicated to the provision of healthcare services in Victoria, and will no longer be available for 'general purposes'. This will not impact upon the aggregate amount of GST paid to Victoria, or distribution of GST among states and territories. The distribution of GST grants between states and territories is determined by the GST relativities, which are determined by the Commonwealth Treasurer on the basis of recommendations from the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC). The CGC updates its relativities annually to reflect movements in data, with a comprehensive methodology review every five years. The latest review, the Report on GST Revenue Sharing Relativities 2010 Review (the 2010 Review), was completed in February 2010. The recommendations of the 2010 Review were accepted by the Commonwealth Treasurer in March 2010 and will be used for the first time to distribute GST revenue in 2010-11. This will increase Victoria's GST share to 23.4 per cent of the total GST pool in 2010-11, compared with 22.8 per cent in 2009-10. In 2010-11, GST grant payments are expected to be $11 143 million which represents an increase of $998 million (9.8 per cent), compared to the 2009-10 revised estimate. This compares with an estimated increase of 7.3 per cent in the total GST pool. Victoria's higher GST growth reflects its increased share of the GST revenue pool principally as a result of the revised relativities recommended by the 2010 Review. Outcomes from the 2010 Commonwealth Grants Commission Review The recommendations of the CGC are underpinned by the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The CGC attempts to comprehensively equalise the financial capacities of all states based on estimates of their revenue raising capacities, the cost of providing standard state services and the cost of providing required capital. The 2010 Review introduced the assessment of capital requirements (in terms of infrastructure and financial assets) for the first time. Approximately every five years, the CGC reviews the methodology used to distribute the GST. Terms of reference for the 2010 Review (issued May 2005) instructed the CGC to simplify its assessments and to use more robust data and methods. This sought to make the methodology more transparent and the results more easily explained and justified. The 2010 Review was completed in February 2010. The 2010 Review represents an improvement in the current redistribution model. The CGC's revised methodology has been simplified through the aggregation of expense and revenue categories, the use of broader indicators of differences among states and the application of materiality thresholds. The new relativities more appropriately share the responsibility for supporting the smaller states and territories across the four largest states. However, Victoria still has serious concerns about the appropriateness of some aspects of the CGC methodology. This includes the inappropriate treatment of funding for Victoria's Regional Rail Link , the impact of which would be to substantially offset Commonwealth funding for this project (see Chapter 5, Budget Paper No. 2). More broadly, the current approach to horizontal fiscal equalisation remains unacceptably volatile and unduly complex, and Victoria continues to seek more comprehensive reform. OTHER COMMONWEALTH GRANTS Grants for specific purposes (including specific purpose grants for on-passing) are expected to be $11 637 million in 2010-11, a decrease of $205 million (1.7 per cent) on the 2009-10 revised estimate. These Commonwealth grants are detailed in Table 4.9 below.

These grants are estimated to increase by 38.6 per cent to $343 million in 2010-11. The variance from the 2009-10 revised estimate to the 2010-11 Budget estimate is due to the receipt of 25 per cent of the 2009-10 payment in the fourth quarter of 2008-09 and the indexation of the grants pool in line with inflation and population growth. Identified local roads grants to local government Funding to local councils is provided on a per capita and road length basis pursuant to the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 . These grants are estimated to increase by 38.6 per cent to $127 million in 2010-11.

They include tax free thresholds and can also take the form of exempting or applying a lower rate, deductions or rebate of a tax for a certain class of taxpayer, activity or asset (this excludes generally applying marginal tax rates). Table 5.1 shows aggregate tax expenditure estimates excluding thresholds by the main categories of tax for the period 2009-10 to 2013-14. Tax expenditures are expected to increase by $451 million over this period, reflecting the growth in property prices and the economy more generally. In particular, land tax expenditures are expected to grow in line with the land tax revenue profile, while estimates of payroll tax expenditures are anticipated to increase moderately, reflecting expected employment and wages growth.

Certain characteristics of the consumer, such as possession of a Commonwealth pension card or a health care card, are the basis for entitlement. Concessions allow certain groups in the community to access and/or purchase important amenities like energy, health and transportation at a cheaper rate or zero cost. This year, concessions reporting aims to provide a more detailed analysis on each major category, with an increase in the number of categories from five in the 2009-10 Budget to 12, acting upon the recommendation made by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee. Chart 5.1 shows the estimated distribution of concessions by category for 2009-10. At an aggregate level, the majority of concessions are concentrated in health (ambulance, dental and spectacles and community health programs) accounting for 45 per cent of total concessions. Energy, municipal rates, water and sewerage is the next largest category, accounting for 24 per cent of total concessions in 2009-10, while transport accounts for 21 per cent of total concessions. Chart 5.1: Estimated concessions by category 2009-10 Public transport, 9% Education, 6% Social and community services, 1% Municipal rate concessions, 6% Mains gas, 4% Electricity, 5% Community Health Programs, 9% Dental and Spectacles, 10% Ambulance, 25% Water and sewerage, 9% Private transport, 12% Hardship schemes, 4% Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Table 5.5 classifies the major concessions provided by the Victorian Government by category. The estimated total value of major concessions in 2009-10 is $1 261 million. Any change in the economic outlook will impact on the estimates of concessions.

The energy, municipal rates, water and sewerage category consists of concessions for electricity and gas usage, municipal rates, water and sewerage charges and other small concessions related to energy usage. Health concessions include free emergency ambulance transport for concession holders, as well as community and dental services and optical concessions. Health also includes community health programs. Education concessions include the education maintenance allowance and concessions for pre-school. The hardship assistance programs category includes utility relief, capital grant schemes and trustee services. These schemes provide one off assistance to concession holders for, among other things, the upgrade of essential appliances or to pay utility bills in the event of an unforeseen financial crisis. Trustee services include the provision of administration services for people unable to manage their own financial affairs. The social and community services category include concessions for non-profit organisations such as the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Buying Service, Victorian Council of Social Service, Community Information Victoria, Bereavement Assistance Limited, the charity freight service and the VicRelief Foodbank. Transport concessions consist of a discount on Transport Accident Commission premiums for pensioners and funding for the Multi Purpose Taxi program, as well as public transport concessions."

The Public Account is maintained at one or more banks, as required by the Financial Management Act 1994 (FMA). The State's financial transactions on the Public Account are recorded in the public ledger. The FMA also provides for: \u2022 temporary advances from the Public Account for a number of purposes related to the needs of the Government; \u2022 investment of the Public Account in trustee securities; and \u2022 temporary borrowings, should the balance in the Consolidated Fund be insufficient to meet commitments during a financial year. Consolidated Fund The Consolidated Fund is the Government's primary financial account, established by the FMA, and receives all consolidated revenue under the Constitution Act 1975 from which payments, appropriated by Parliament, are made. The Trust Fund Within the Public Account, the Trust Fund embraces a range of specific purpose accounts established for funds that are not subject to state appropriation. Examples of these accounts include specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth passed on by the State to third parties, accounts holding balances in suspense accounts for accounting purposes, working accounts for commercial and departmental service units, and accounts facilitating the receipt and disbursement of private funds held by the State in trust. Additional funds may also be established within the Trust Fund to receive state revenues hypothecated to particular purposes (e.g. lotteries revenue for hospitals and charities).

These can be classified into either quantifiable, where the potential economic benefit is known, or non-quantifiable. Quantifiable contingent assets Table 7.1 below contains quantifiable contingent assets as at June 2009 and revised estimates of these contingent assets as at June 2010. Table 7.1: Quantifiable contingent assets ($ million) As at Jun 2009 Estimate for Jun 2010 Guarantees, indemnities and warranties 2.0 2.0 Legal proceedings and disputes .. .. Other (a)(b) 128.8 154.7 Total contingent assets 130.8 156.7 Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Notes: (a) 2010 includes the Channel Deepening Project Environmental Performance Bond of $100 million and the EastLink project construction bond of $42 million. The remaining amounts in 'Other' relate to smaller individual contingencies. (b) 2009 also includes the Channel Deepening Project Environmental Performance Bond of $100 million and the EastLink project construction bond of $49 million. The remaining amounts in 'Other' relate to smaller individual contingencies. EastLink ConnectEast, the concessionaire for the EastLink project, has provided a construction bond in relation to the project. The EastLink concession deed provides for staged reductions in the amount of the construction bond at certain milestone dates. The first of these reductions was prescribed to occur on the date which was one month after the last date of tolling completion, which occurred on 13 June 2008. Accordingly, the construction bond was reduced by 50 per cent from $88 million to $44 million (as required by the concession deed) on 13 July 2008. It was reduced further to $22 million one month after issue of a certificate of close out, dated 30 July 2009. ConnectEast has also provided a $5 million operating phase bond (indexed). In the event of certain 'events of default', there is potential for this amount to increase to $20 million (indexed). Channel Deepening Project Environmental Performance Bond On 14 December 2007, the Minister for Environment and Climate Change approved the Channel Deepening Project under the Coastal Management Act 1995 . The approval of such was subject to a number of conditions, including the Port of Melbourne Corporation providing a $100 million environmental performance bond in favour of the Minister for Environment and Climate Change. Should it be called upon, the performance bond would be used for any remedial action or post dredging recovery works as agreed with the Minister for Roads and Ports. Non-quantifiable contingent assets There are probable future economic benefits to the government which are not quantifiable at this time. An overview of the more significant non-quantifiable contingent assets follows. CityLink compensable enhancement claims The Melbourne CityLink concession deed contains compensable enhancement provisions that enable the Victorian Government to claim 50 per cent of additional revenue derived by CityLink Melbourne Ltd (CML) as a result of certain events that particularly benefit CityLink, including changes to the adjoining road network. Compensable enhancement claims have previously been lodged by the Victorian Government relating to works improving traffic flows on the West Gate Freeway (between Lorimer and Montague Streets), and the Tullamarine Freeway (in the vicinity of the intersection with Bulla Road). The claims were lodged on 20 May 2005 and 29 September 2006 respectively, and are still outstanding. Revenue sharing from the Monash-CityLink-West Gate upgrade On 25 July 2006, CML, Transurban Infrastructure Management Ltd (TIML) and the Victorian Government entered into the M1 Corridor redevelopment deed. Under the terms of this deed, the Victorian Government will upgrade the Monash and West Gate Freeways, while CML will upgrade the Southern Link section of CityLink. The Victorian Government will become entitled to 50 per cent of the additional CityLink revenue created by the Monash-CityLink-West Gate upgrade after CML recovers its construction and additional operating costs relating to works on the Southern Link. The method used to calculate the additional CityLink revenue generated from the upgrade is to be based on comparing actual CityLink revenue against agreed trends. The actual calculation of the additional CityLink revenue will take place three full financial years after completion of the upgrade. EastLink On 14 October 2004, the State entered into a concession deed with ConnectEast to design, construct, finance and operate EastLink. In addition to the quantifiable contingent assets listed earlier, there is a non-quantifiable contingent asset relating to the hand over bond through which ConnectEast has an obligation to the State, in certain limited circumstances, to cover project rectification costs to the end of the concession period in 2043. Contingent asset arising from goods and services tax Eligibility to claim input tax credits for payment of certain transport related subsidies was heard in October 2009 and was found in favour of the Department of Transport. In November 2009, the Commissioner of Taxation appealed the decision. To date, the appeal has not been heard. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES A contingent liability is: \u2022 a possible obligation that arises from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or \u2022 a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because: \u2212 it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or \u2212 the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. As with contingent assets, contingent liabilities are also classified as either quantifiable or non-quantifiable. Quantifiable contingent liabilities Table 7.2 below contains quantifiable contingent liabilities as at June 2009 and revised estimates of these contingent liabilities as at June 2010.

Non-quantifiable contingent liabilities There are other commitments, made by government, which are non-quantifiable at this time, arising from: \u2022 indemnities provided in relation to transactions, including financial arrangements and consultancy services, as well as for directors and administrators; \u2022 performance guarantees, warranties, letters of comfort, and the like; \u2022 deeds in respect of certain obligations; and \u2022 unclaimed moneys which may be subject to future claims by the general public against the State. An overview of the more significant non-quantifiable liabilities follows. 2009 Victorian Bushfires In early 2009, devastating fires impacted many parts of Victoria. These fires have impacted significantly on local communities and required the application of material resources by the State to assist with the fire suppression, recovery and reconstruction of the affected areas, with the Commonwealth Government agreeing to jointly fund relevant programs. The Victorian Government announced the establishment of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority to coordinate the activities of local, state and Commonwealth government agencies, and the communities involved, to assist with recovery and rebuilding activity across Victoria. While significant expenditure has been funded in 2009-10 and included in the 2010-11 Budget Papers , as at the date of the publication of this report, the full financial impact of this catastrophic event on the State of Victoria is yet to be quantified. Asset sales Potential exposures are associated with the sale of a number of assets and services where the purchaser was provided with various indemnities and warranties. Royal Melbourne Showgrounds redevelopment The State, through the Department of Primary Industries (DPI), and the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV) formed an unincorporated joint venture for the purposes of undertaking the redevelopment project of the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds (the Showgrounds), with the State and the RASV each holding 50 per cent interest in the joint venture. The joint venture participants (State and RASV) then established an incorporated entity, Showgrounds Nominees Pty Ltd, to enter into contractual arrangements with the concessionaire. The project is a Public Private Partnership delivered under the Victorian Government's Partnerships Victoria (PV) framework. It involves a partnership with a private sector consortium (concessionaire), which was responsible for the design, construction and financing of the Showgrounds redevelopment and continues to be responsible for maintaining and providing facility management services at the Showgrounds for a period of 25 years, commencing from August 2006. Under the PV contract, the State supports the underlying payment obligations of the joint venture participants to Showgrounds Nominees Pty Ltd, to meet its obligations to pay the service fee to the concessionaire. Any actual financial support provided by the State to the RASV under the PV contract will be treated as a loan, which will be repaid by the RASV by the end of the 25-year contract term. Repayment by the RASV may take the form of the transfer to the State of part or whole of the RASV's participating interest in the joint venture. Separately and similarly, under another agreement between the State and RASV, the State supports certain obligations of the RASV which may arise out of a suite of joint venture agreements between the State and the RASV or between the joint venture and a third party. In accordance with this agreement, the State will meet certain RASV obligations in the form of a loan, up to a maximum of $20 million, if requested by the RASV when the RASV does not have the financial capacity to pay. National Electricity Code Administrator As part of the wind up of the National Electricity Code Administrator (NECA), the State has undertaken to indemnify the actions of the NECA Directors for a period of seven years upon completion of their tenure. Australian Energy Market Operator Ltd In order for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) to participate in the national electricity market administered by Australian Energy Market Operator Ltd (AEMO), a guarantee must be provided to AEMO by an acceptable financial institution. Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV) has provided such a guarantee whereby it undertakes to pay to AEMO on demand any and all amounts to an aggregate amount not exceeding $147 million as security for the obligations of SECV to AEMO. The guarantee is issued pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Treasury Corporation of Victoria Act 1992 and is approved by the Treasurer. The guarantee is fully supported by an indemnity from SECV and by non-withdrawable deposits which SECV is obliged to maintain with TCV at an amount of 101 per cent of the amount guaranteed. Public transport rail partnership agreements The Director of Public Transport (the Director), on behalf of the Crown, entered into partnership contractual arrangements with franchisees to operate metropolitan rail transport services in the State, operative from 30 November 2009 until 30 November 2017. The following summarises the major contingent liabilities arising from the arrangements. Contingent liabilities on early termination or expiry of franchise agreement Franchise assets: to maintain continuity of services, the assets, at early termination or expiry of the franchise agreement, will revert to the Director or a successor. In the case of some assets, a reversion back to the Director would entail those assets being purchased. Unfunded superannuation: at the early termination or expiry of the contract, the Director will assume any unfunded superannuation amounts (apart from contributions the franchisee is required to pay over the contract term) to the extent that the State becomes the successor operator. OneLink Transit Systems performance bonus A contingent liability exists in relation to the performance bonus component of the contract with OneLink Transit Systems. It is more likely than not that system and equipment availability and overall performance achievements in 2010-11 through to the end of the contract may be higher than the originally set forecast level for performance bonus payments given a pro-active maintenance regime that may result in better than expected equipment reliability. At this time, it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of potential performance bonus payments as this will be impacted by variables, such as patronage growth, equipment performance and vandalism. In particular, performance of these variables will be impacted by the reliability of equipment which is nearing the end of its design life. Kamco performance-related payments A contingent liability exists in relation to performance-related payments associated with, and incorporated into the new ticketing solution (myki) contract with Kamco (Keane Australia Micropayments Consortium Pty Ltd). Contingent liability arising from goods and services tax CityLink Melbourne Ltd and the Victorian Government have approached the Australian Taxation Office seeking clarification as to the applicability of Goods and Services Tax legislation in respect of services and supplies provided under the Melbourne CityLink concession deed. Discussions with the Australian Taxation Office are continuing. EastLink On 14 October 2004, the State entered into a concession deed with ConnectEast to design, construct, finance and operate EastLink. The major non-quantifiable contingent liability arising from the concession deed relates to the Key Risk Management Regime. The regime relates to the occurrence of certain circumstances that may have a detrimental impact on the concessionaire's ability to achieve its forecast returns. It identifies the areas that enable the concessionaire to claim redress from the State. These may include acts of prevention, failure to support a principal road interface, changes in State law, native title and the environmental effects statement. Native Title A number of claims have been filed with the Federal Court under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cwth) that affect Victoria. While many such claims are being processed through the legal system, the Government has committed itself to resolving claims through mediation, where possible. It is not feasible at this time to quantify any future liability. Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Indemnities are provided by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) to: \u2022 the Commonwealth in various funding contracts entered with the Commonwealth throughout the year. Each indemnity is limited to $10 million for personal injuries and property damages, and $50 million for damages arising out of internet usage; \u2022 teachers, volunteer workers and school chaplains. The specific indemnity in respect to teachers is only in relation to negligence claims by students, provided the teacher was not intoxicated, or engaged in a criminal offence, or engaged in outrageous conduct, and was incurred in the course of the teacher's employment. Indemnities are also provided to teachers, as well as all other Departmental employees, in accordance with the Government policy and guidelines: indemnities and immunities, June 2008 (DTF); and \u2022 members of school councils. The Education and Training Reform Act 2006 provides a specific indemnity to members of school councils for any legal liability, whether in contract, negligence, and defamation, etc. The Government also provides an indemnity for persons employed under the Public Administration Act 2004 . In relation to Victorian Public Service (VPS) employees under the Public Administration Act 2004 , the Department has an additional obligation under the VPS Agreement to indemnify in relation to the costs of employment related legal proceedings. The Biosciences Research Centre Project The Biosciences Research Centre (BRC) Project is a joint initiative between the Victorian Government, through the Department of Primary Industries (DPI), and La Trobe University (La Trobe). The project is being delivered as a Public Private Partnership in accordance with the Victorian Government's Partnerships Victoria (PV) framework. DPI and La Trobe have formed an unincorporated joint venture for the purposes of undertaking the BRC Project. The State holds 75 per cent participating interest and La Trobe holds 25 per cent participating interest in the joint venture. The facility that is being constructed will be known as AgriBio , the Centre for AgriBioscience. The project involves a partnership between the joint venture and the private sector consortium, Plenary Research Pty Ltd (the concessionaire), which is responsible for the design, construction, commissioning and financing of AgriBio and the provision of contracted services required for the maintenance and operation of the facility. The joint venture participants established an incorporated entity known as Biosciences Research Centre Pty Ltd for the purposes of entering into the contractual arrangements with the concessionaire. Construction of AgriBio commenced in May 2009, the new facility is expected to be commissioned in late 2011 and fully operational in 2012. Under the PV contract, the service fee payment obligations of Biosciences Research Centre Pty Ltd (on behalf of the joint venture participants) are supported by the State of Victoria. In accordance with the contract, the State supports the underlying payment obligations of the joint venture participants, including La Trobe, to the joint venture company, thereby enabling the joint venture company to meet its obligations to pay the service fee to the concessionaire pursuant to the contract. Any actual financial support provided by the State to La Trobe under the PV contract will be treated as a loan to be repaid by La Trobe by the end of the 25-year contract term. Repayment by La Trobe may take the form of the transfer to the State of part or whole of the La Trobe's participating interest in the joint venture. Royal Children's Hospital The Royal Children's Hospital Foundation (RCHF) has entered into a funding agreement with the Commonwealth Government for the provision of $21 million to undertake the Australian Early Development Index Project. The State has entered into this agreement at the request of the Royal Children's Hospital. In consideration of entering into the funding agreement, the State has agreed to be responsible for the obligations and liabilities imposed on RCHF under the funding agreement including, but not limited, to the indemnity granted by RCHF to the Commonwealth of Australia under clause 19 of the funding agreement. HIH Insurance Group The State's quantifiable direct exposures arising from the collapse of the HIH Insurance Group (HIH) are included in the liabilities shown in the financial statements of the entities directly responsible for them. The State's obligations in respect of its builders' warranty insurance rescue package are also shown as direct liabilities of the relevant government entities. The State also retains some unquantifiable contingent exposures arising from the collapse. These contingent exposures arise primarily through the possibility that the State may be involved in litigation in which it would be entitled to recover damages from third parties. If these third parties were insured by HIH, recovery in full may not be possible. Land remediation - environmental concerns In addition to properties for which remediation costs have been provided in the State's financial statements, certain other properties have been identified as potentially contaminated sites. The State does not admit any liability in respect of these sites. However, remedial expenditure may be incurred to restore the sites to an acceptable environmental standard in the event of future developments taking place. Victorian Managed Insurance Authority - insurance cover The Victorian Managed Insurance Authority (VMIA) was established in 1996 as an insurer for departments and participating bodies (predominantly in the general government sector). VMIA provides its client bodies with a range of insurance cover, including for property, public and products liability, professional indemnity and contract works. VMIA reinsures in the private market for losses above $50 million arising out of any one event, up to a maximum of $750 million for public liability and for losses above $100 million arising out of any one event, up to a maximum of $1.5 billion for property. The risk of losses above these reinsured levels is borne by the State. Effective from 31 March 2010, pursuant to a direction from the Minister for Finance under Section 25A of the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority Act 1996 , the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority will underwrite domestic building insurance. Domestic building insurance - Dexta's claims In mid-April 2002, the State agreed to provide temporary (to 30 June 2002) reinsurance support to domestic building insurance provider Dexta Corporation following the withdrawal of some of its commercial reinsurance support. While this support was subsequently extended to policies issued before 30 September 2002, the Government determined there would be no further extension. The State received reinsurance premiums for this participation and may be required to contribute to payment of reinsured claims, as well as paying management fees. The precise timing and value of these receipts and payments is uncertain, as claims may be made by home owners for up to six and a half years after the arrangement ceases. These claims may also take an additional several years to be processed through the legal system. Receipts and payments will be contingent on the volume of insurance underwritten and reinsured by 30 September 2002. Based on Dexta's previous levels of activity, the central estimate of the State's gross exposure (before premium receipts) is no more than $6 million. While the State expects, like the commercial reinsurers who are party to the agreement, to at least break even on these arrangements, the State retains an unquantifiable contingent liability that claims may exceed the central estimate. Domestic building insurance - catastrophe cover On 13 March 2002, Victoria and New South Wales jointly announced a series of reforms to domestic building insurance arrangements. This announcement included a commitment to provide a catastrophe fund capable of supporting claims above $10 million. To meet this commitment, the two states offered reinsurance arrangements to all builders' warranty insurers covering claims in respect of any one builder in excess of $10 million, with each state reinsuring claims relating to properties in that state. South Australia has since also become involved in these arrangements. Since domestic building insurance commenced, there have been no losses by an insurer to any one builder that exceed this amount. Victoria has reinsurance agreements giving effect to these arrangements with three insurers. The agreements require the insurers to pay the reinsurance premiums to Victoria (and to any other state that is also a party to such an agreement) that are estimated to be sufficient for the State to at least break even on these arrangements. However, the State retains an unquantifiable contingent liability for additional claims. Gambling licences In 1992, a gaming operator's licence was issued to the Trustees of the Will and Estate of the late George Adams, now trading as Tatts Group. In 1994, the State issued a wagering and gaming licence to TABCORP Holdings Ltd (TABCORP). These licences expire in 2012. The Gambling Regulation Act 2003 specifies end of licence arrangements which include compensation provisions for the licensees predicated on the current licensing arrangements being rolled over for a further period beyond 2012. On 10 April 2008, the Government announced a new regulatory model for the post 2012 licences. The main changes include: \u2022 separating the wagering and gaming licence to instead license wagering on a stand alone basis; and \u2022 transitioning from the current gaming operator duopoly to a system where venue operators are licensed to own and operate gaming machines in their own right. After considering the end of licence arrangements in the Gambling Regulation Act 2003 , the Government has formed the view that neither Tatts Group nor TABCORP will be entitled to compensation after the expiration of their current licences. The Government does not intend to alter or amend the provisions in the Gambling Regulation Act 2003 that deal specifically with the end of licence arrangements for Tatts Group and TABCORP."

                    "text": "This appendix provides historical data for the major fiscal aggregates. Wherever possible, adjustments have been made to make the historical series consistent with the forward estimates. For instance, all historical accounting based tables have been presented in the format adopted under Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), and GFS statistical aggregates have been converted to an accruals basis. Also, the historical operating statement and cash flow statement have been revised back to 2004-05 for consistency with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting . However, some breaks in series remain. Table A.1 shows the trends in general government sector aggregate cash flows over the period 1986-87 to 2013-14. This table of historical data has been compiled as far as possible on an AAS basis, and from 2004-05 onwards is consistent with the cash flow statement included in Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes . Note all footnotes are shown at the end of the table. The data from 1997-98 include the transactions of government schools and arts institutions on a gross operating basis, as well as the full trading operations of TAFE institutes and hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances. Although this expanded coverage does not materially influence the net operating result for the general government sector, it does significantly increase the inflows and outflows presented in the cash flow statement. Table A.3 shows the general government sector net operating result from 1996-97 to 2013-14, with 2004-05 onwards presented in compliance with AASB 1049. Table A.5 presents general government sector operating expenses, sourced from Australian Bureau of Statistics historical data, classified by government purpose. The underlying data from 1961-62 to 1997-98 represent a conversion from the original cash series to an accruals basis by estimating depreciation and superannuation expenses based on statistical modelling. Although this conversion provides a basis for comparison both with total expenses in the current series of accrual GFS information from 1998-2014 in Table A.5 and in Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes Table 1.1, the estimated accrued expense items have not been apportioned to individual purpose classifications. The absence of these splits between functional classifications in Table A.5 therefore represents a break in the series and it is not possible to compare individual purpose categories with those in other tables.

Payments in later years were for voluntary redundancy and targeted separation packages across the general government sector and are included under 'employee entitlements'. (b) Privatisation and other abnormal cash items to the general government sector include: - 1986-87 to 1990-91: payments received from the former Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works regarding the transfer of ownership of the Thomson Cardinia Dam of $35 million a year; - 1990-91: net proceeds from the sale of the State Bank ($1 257 million); - 1992-93: sale of the State Insurance Office ($140 million); - 1993-94: recall of capital from the Transport Accident Commission ($1 200 million), wind up of the Victorian Equity Trust ($437 million), casino licence fee ($200 million), offset by a special payment to the State Superannuation Fund ($1 399 million); - 1994-95: sale of Totalisator Agency Board ($609 million); - 1995-96: sale of electricity sector businesses ($4 641 million), 1996-97 ($4 262 million), and 1997-98 ($2 101 million) offset by a special payment to the State Superannuation Fund ($490 million); and - 1998-99: sale of the remainder of the electricity businesses ($361 million), gas businesses ($4 690 million), Victorian Plantations Corporation ($550 million), Aluvic ($401 million), V/Line Freight ($20 million), offset by a special payment to reduce the State's unfunded superannuation liabilities ($2 574 million). (c) From 1997-98, includes school own purpose receipts and payments which boosted sales of goods and services and other receipts by up to $500 million, but had little impact on the net cash flows because of offsetting payments. This year also saw the introduction of tax equivalent receipts from public non financial corporations and public financial corporations. (d) From 1998-99, includes a capital asset charge receipt from the PNFC sector, offset by a similar increase in grants and transfer payments. (e) Cash and deposits at beginning of reporting period in 2005-06 do not equal cash and deposits at end of reporting period in 2004-05, due to a change in definition of cash and cash equivalents under A-IFRS. (f) Goods and services from 2007-08 onwards include other payments. (g) Net borrowings from 2007-08 onwards includes advances received and deposits received.

Comparisons are made to the revised 2009-10 full year estimates, as presented in Appendix C Revised 2009-10 Budget Outcome . The net result from transactions was a surplus of $408 million for the nine month period, despite the continuing difficult economic and financial market conditions. Total revenue was $32 456 million for the nine months to 31 March 2010, representing 74.2 per cent of the full year revised budget estimate of $43 746 million. This mainly reflects lower than pro rata income from grants received from the Commonwealth Government. Taxation revenue was $10 413 million (76.3 per cent of the revised estimate) for the nine month period. A key contribution for this higher than pro rata result was land tax revenue which is recognised in the March quarter, when assessment notices are issued. Expenses from transactions as at 31 March 2010 totalled $32 049 million, which represents 73.9 per cent of the full year revised budget estimate of $43 351 million. This result, in line with historical trends, reflects the normal seasonal pattern of service delivery, where expenses are weighted towards the last quarter of the financial year.

(b) Merging of the Southern Cross Station Authority into the Department of Transport from 1 August 2009 has resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of asset revaluation reserves, offset by a movement in accumulated funds relating to the same transaction.

(A) Compliance framework This report is a special purpose consolidated interim financial report of the general government sector for the quarter ending 31 March 2010 as required by Section 26 of the Financial Management Act 1994 . The Quarterly Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 , relevant Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), including those paragraphs applicable to not-for-profit entities, and AASB Interpretations and other authoritative pronouncements. This unaudited special purpose financial report should be read in conjunction with the 2008-09 Financial Report for the State of Victoria and 2009-10 Mid Year Financial Report . It only includes explanatory notes that provide relevant information on a quarterly reporting basis. (B) Basis of accounting and measurement The accrual basis of accounting has been employed in the preparation of this financial report whereby assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses are recognised in the reporting period to which they relate, regardless of when cash will be received or paid. (C) General government sector reporting entity The general government sector includes all government departments, offices and other government bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. The services provided by these entities are financed mainly through taxes, other compulsory levies and user charges. The general government sector is not a separate entity but represents a sector within the State of Victoria reporting entity. (D) Basis of consolidation The Quarterly Financial Report includes all reporting entities in the general government sector that are controlled by the State.

The revised 2009-10 estimates take into account government policy decisions and economic developments impacting on both income and expenses since the presentation of the 2009-10 Budget to Parliament in May 2009. This appendix also references the major policy decisions and commitments of the Commonwealth Government that have impacted on the financial position of Victoria in 2009-10. REVISED 2009-10 COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING STATEMENT The revised 2009-10 comprehensive operating statement is presented in Table C.1. It shows that the revised general government sector net result from transactions for 2009-10 is estimated at $395 million, $165 million higher than the 2009-10 Budget estimate and $133 million higher than that estimated in the 2009-10 Budget Update .

Revenue from transactions Total estimated revenue from transactions for 2009-10 has been revised upward by $1 357 million (3.2 per cent) from the 2009-10 Budget estimate of $42 388 million. Of this movement, $743 million was reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . The major factors contributing to the revision in estimates are discussed below. Taxation In 2009-10, taxation revenue is expected to amount to $13 642 million, $368 million (2.8 per cent) higher than the original 2009-10 Budget estimate and an upward revision of $147 million since the 2009-10 Budget Update .

This reflects a greater than expected rebound in the property market, particularly property prices, following the downturn in 2008-09. However, the revised figure of $3 498 million remains well below the forecast of $3 711 million presented in the 2008-09 Budget ; \u2022 payroll tax has been revised downwards by $60 million (1.5 per cent) in 2009-10, including a $9 million downward revision reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update , due to lower than expected revenue for the year-to-date, in part reflecting lower than expected average hours worked per employee; \u2022 insurance taxes have been revised upwards by $125 million (9.8 per cent) in 2009-10 including a $99 million upward revision reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . This reflects higher than expected insurance premiums and growth in the economy, as well as an upward revision of statutory insurance industry contributions to the Country Fire Authority, for initiatives to prepare for the 2009-10 bushfire season and to respond to recommendations by the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission's Interim Report (August 2009); and \u2022 motor vehicle taxation revenue has been revised upwards by $59 million (4.4 per cent) in 2009-10 including a $55 million upward revision reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . This is driven by stronger than expected revenue in motor vehicle duties, predominately at the end of 2009, coinciding with the ending of the Commonwealth Government's small and general business tax break. Dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue In 2009-10, dividends, income tax and rate equivalent income is expected to be $459 million, $80 million (21.0 per cent) higher than forecast in the 2009-10 Budget (see Table C.3), but an upwards revision of $113 million from that reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . This largely reflects the higher profitability of the metropolitan water sector following the Essential Services Commission's final water pricing determinations, as well as higher than expected dividend payments from the Port of Melbourne Corporation due to stronger economic conditions. Table C.3: 2009-10 Dividends and income tax equivalent and rate equivalent revenue ($ million) 2009-10 2009-10 Change Change Budget Revised % Dividends 255.3 307.8 52.6 20.6 Income tax equivalent revenue 117.9 146.7 28.9 24.5 Local government rate equivalent revenue 6.2 4.6 ( 1.6) (25.8) Total dividends and income tax equivalent and rate equivalent revenue 379.4 459.2 79.8 21.0 Grants revenue Total grants revenue is expected to be $22 111 million in 2009-10, $557 million (2.6 per cent) higher than the 2009-10 Budget (see Table C.4). The increase reflects an upward revision to GST revenue of $730 million (7.8 per cent) since the 2009-10 Budget (including $501 million since the 2008-09 Budget Update ). This is due to a higher than expected GST pool, based on an assessment of the latest Commonwealth information.

This is largely due to an increase in revenue from farebox collections under new rail contracts which came into operation on 30 November 2009, as well as increases in TAFE institutes fee revenue from both international and domestic students. Other current revenue is $54 million higher than the original 2009-10 Budget estimate. Of this movement, $39 million was reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . The increase is primarily driven by the one-off transfer of land from Melbourne City Council following recent changes in legislation. Expenses from transactions As shown in Table C.1, general government sector operating expenses for 2009-10 are now projected to be $43 351 million, $1 192 million higher than the May 2009 budget estimate of $42 159 million. Of this movement, $711 million was reported in the 2009-10 Budget Update . The major variation within operating expenses is attributable to an upward revision of other operating expenses of $542 million (3.9 per cent), largely as a result of the recognition of expenditure (and related revenue) in relation to the new rail contracts which came into operation on 30 November 2009. Depreciation is also expected to increase by $242 million (14.7 per cent) since the 2009-10 Budget estimate, primarily due to accounting for additional depreciation and amortisation expenditure as a result of revaluation of health services' buildings and other non current physical assets, together with a reassessment of the useful lives of these assets, performed by the Victorian Valuer-General's Office. Net result The difference between the net result and the net result from transactions is due to other economic flows. Other economic flows include actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit superannuation plans, various revaluation gains and losses on assets and liabilities and provision for doubtful debts. In particular, the non-cash impact of actuarial gains and losses on superannuation liabilities that arise due to movements in bond rates and investment markets add substantial volatility to the net result. Given that the Government has no direct control over these factors, the net result from transactions is the more appropriate measure of the Government's financial management. The net result for 2009-10 is expected to be $1 499 million, compared with an estimated net result of $243 million in the 2009-10 Budget . This variance is largely due to better than expected investment returns on superannuation assets during 2009-10 which contributed approximately $1.4 billion to the actuarial gain on superannuation. However, the impact of this favourable investment experience was partially offset by actuarial losses that arose due to changes in bond yields that underpin some key valuation assumptions. REVISED 2009-10 BALANCE SHEET The 2009-10 balance sheet is presented in Table C.5. Net assets are projected to increase by $4 812 million over the course of 2009-10 to be $121 486 million at 30 June 2010, $25 million higher than forecast in the 2009-10 Budget Update estimates.

Total assets are projected to increase by $6 963 million from 2009 to 2010. This movement largely reflects an increase in infrastructure assets driven by additional investment and asset revaluations, partially offset by a reduction in cash and receivables. Total liabilities are projected to increase by $2 151 million. The increase in liabilities largely reflects increased borrowings to fund investment in infrastructure, and higher other employee benefit liabilities due to the reduction in the bond rate affecting the valuation of long service leave liabilities. The reduction in the superannuation liability is primarily attributable to better than expected investment returns on superannuation assets. However, as noted previously, the impact of this favourable investment experience was partially offset by actuarial losses that arose due to changes in bond yields that underpin some key valuation assumptions. REVISED 2009-10 CASH FLOW STATEMENT Table C.6 provides the revised cash flow statement for 2009-10. Table C.7 provides a summary of cash generated through the operations of Victorian government departments and other general government sector agencies during the year, and how cash is applied to infrastructure investment and financing activities. Table C.7 also provides a reconciliation of the projected budget operating surplus to the projected change in general government net debt. Net cash flows from operating activities are expected to be $331 million higher than at the 2009-10 Budget . The variation reflects the impact of a $1 412 million increase in operating receipts, offset by a $1 081 million increase in payments in relation to operating activities. The expected increase in receipts mainly reflects the factors underlying the increase in operating income, in particular, the increased grants received from the Commonwealth. The increase in expenditure on goods and services payments is similarly reflected in increased expenditure of cash for operating purposes.

Infrastructure investment As shown in Table C.7, the $2 642 million net cash inflows from operating activities is a significant source of financing for the Government's infrastructure investment program in 2009-10. The Government's net investment in fixed assets (which includes purchases of property, plant and equipment, capital contributions to other sectors of government and net proceeds from sale of assets) is projected to be $6 013 million in 2009-10. Compared with the 2009-10 Budget estimates, net debt is expected to be $1 265 million lower than originally anticipated, primarily due to lower than expected borrowings.
