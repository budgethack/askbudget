                    "text": "Budget Paper No. 3, Service Delivery , provides information about the goods and services the Government intends to deliver over the forward estimates. This budget paper provides the link between the Government's key priorities and outcomes, identified in Growing Victoria Together and outlined in Budget Paper No. 2, Strategy and Outlook , and the outputs delivered by individual government departments. Budget Paper No. 3 is the primary source of information of the service delivery plans of individual departments and outlines the Government's service delivery achievements to date. This budget paper consists of the following chapters and appendices: Chapter 1 - Service and budget strategies This chapter details the Government's 2010-11 service delivery and budget initiatives, and their link to achieving the longer term outcomes that are set out in Growing Victoria Together . In this chapter, output funding for an initiative is generally expressed over a four year period. Funding for asset initiatives is expressed as the total estimated investment (TEI) over the life of the project. Chapter 2 - Linking departmental outputs to government outcomes This chapter provides a high level overview of the Government's service delivery achievements over the last 11 years and their relationship to achieving the ten goals set out in Growing Victoria Together . Chapter 3 - Departmental output statements Departmental output statements detail the goods and services that government departments intend to deliver in 2010-11 and how they will contribute to achieving the goals set out in Growing Victoria Together . Each departmental output statement lists the performance measures and targets expressed as quantity, quality, timeliness and cost for each output to be delivered in 2010-11. For each performance measure, the departmental output statements include the 2010-11 target, and where applicable the 2009-10 Budget target, 2009-10 expected outcome and 2008-09 actual result. The cost measure for each output is the total output cost which is derived from all revenue sources including State appropriation. Chapter 4 - Election commitments implementation report card This chapter summarises the implementation of the Government's election commitments under Labor's Financial Statement 2006 . Appendix A - Output, asset investment and revenue initiatives Appendix A contains summary descriptions and detailed tables for all new outputs, asset investments, revenue and savings initiatives announced since the 2009-10 Budget . It includes a cross reference between output initiatives and their relevant departmental output(s), which aims to clearly indicate the impact of policy decisions on relevant portfolios and reinforces the Government's commitment to greater transparency and accountability in the budget papers. Appendix B - Growing Victoria Together progress report Launched in 2001-02, Growing Victoria Together sets out the Government's vision to 2010 and beyond, balancing the Government's economic, social and environmental responsibilities. A revised edition of Growing Victoria Together was released in March 2005. Appendix B contains the Government's eighth report and details progress towards meeting the goals of the policy. Appendix C - Discontinued outputs and/or measures Appendix C contains details of those previously published outputs and performance measures that will be discontinued in 2010-11, including reasons for their discontinuation. Appendix D - Local government financial relations Appendix D describes activities in the local government sector and the State's funding contribution to local government in Victoria. This appendix also highlights the 2010-11 Budget initiatives that will have a major impact on local government. Appendix E - Victorian Transport Plan report card Appendix E summarises the implementation of the Government's commitments under the Victorian Transport Plan. Machinery of government changes since the 2009-10 Budget In August 2009 the Premier announced the creation of a new Department of Health to assume responsibility for all health services, mental health, aged care and preventative health in Victoria from the Department of Human Services. The Department of Human Services continues to deliver all other remaining functions such as housing, disability services, and child protection and family services. The new administrative arrangements came into effect on 12 August 2009, through an Order of the Governor in Council establishing the new Department of Health. Administrative Arrangements Order No. 202 made a number of administrative changes necessary as a result of the new arrangements. These machinery of government changes have been reflected in the 2010-11 Budget papers."

                    "text": "\u2022 The 2010-11 Budget invests in the services and infrastructure that are essential to building a better future for all Victorians, by supporting a strong economy that sustains a fairer society. The 2010-11 Budget funds new actions to protect the lifestyles of Victorian families across the State and to help communities plan for the future and maintain the liveability and amenity of our regions, towns and suburbs. \u2022 The 2010-11 Budget is delivered against the backdrop of ongoing global uncertainty, an uneven global recovery and a significant reduction in revenue from state taxation and GST due to lower levels of economic activity as a result of the global downturn. \u2022 While the global financial crisis has affected Victoria's economy and financial position, the 2010-11 Budget reflects the success of the Government's sustained and prudent strategies implemented to address the crisis. The Government has invested strongly in job-securing infrastructure, innovation and skills and has pursued an active economic reform agenda aimed at building a more diverse and competitive economy. These actions have led to Victoria weathering the global financial crisis better than most. Almost 100 000 jobs have been created in Victoria since March 2009, representing almost half of all jobs created nationally and highlighting Victoria as a standout in the national economy. \u2022 In February 2009, devastating bushfires swept across Victoria. Over the past year, Victoria has continued to invest in an extensive reconstruction, rebuilding and recovery effort in areas such as Kinglake, Marysville and Callignee. \u2022 Despite these challenges, the Government's disciplined financial management has ensured that the Victorian budget remains in surplus. Debt remains at sustainable levels and Moody's and Standard and Poor's have confirmed Victoria's AAA credit rating. \u2022 Tax cuts worth around $5.7 billion have been announced since 1999, including significant reductions in business taxes. The tax measures in this Budget provide for a $223 million total cut to business taxes and costs over four years, including a $193 million reduction in payroll tax. \u2022 To assist Victorian first homebuyers, provide construction jobs, and to encourage the supply of additional housing, the Government is retargeting the First Home Bonus towards newly constructed homes. The Bonus will increase by $2 000 to $13 000. The Budget also provides for the Regional First Home Bonus to be increased by $2 000 to $6 500 for newly constructed homes in regional Victoria. \u2022 In this Budget, the Government is seeking to maximise the potential benefits from the recovery by continuing to invest in key infrastructure to support jobs and provide services to make Victoria one of the best places to live, work and raise a family. \u2022 The Government's commitment to infrastructure is highlighted by the Regional Rail Link project which will be delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth. The 2010-11 Budget provides Victoria's contribution to the $4.3 billion project, which is a key component of the Victorian Transport Plan, and will deliver substantial benefits to both Melbourne and regional Victoria. \u2022 Victoria is widely acknowledged as having a high-performing and efficient health system. Through the 2010-11 Budget and in partnership with the Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreement on national health reform, Victorian patients will benefit from $4 billion worth of new health and hospital services and capital improvements. \u2022 A significant $1.2 billion TEI will be made in health care infrastructure, so that more Victorians will be able to access high quality health facilities close to their homes. This takes investment in Victorian health care facilities since the 2009-10 Budget to $2.3 billion TEI. \u2022 The 2010-11 Budget also includes a major investment in community safety. The Government will provide $561 million over five years plus $112 million over four years to deliver an additional 1 966 frontline police to make Victorian communities safer. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing community safety concerns, particularly alcohol-related violence and assaults. \u2022 In response to increasing birth rates and recognising that children benefit from the best opportunities in life from an early age, the Government is investing $191 million over five years to meet demand for early childhood services and provide more support for children with a disability or developmental delay. \u2022 The Government is also investing in quality educational facilities to help students learn and develop. In this Budget an additional $381 million TEI of funding will complete the $1.9 billion first tranche of the Victorian Schools Plan, which has now funded the rebuilding or modernising of 553 government schools across the State. The Victorian Schools Plan is complemented by the $2.6 billion investment in Victorian schools through the Building the Education Revolution program which is being delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth. \u2022 The Government is continuing to implement initiatives outlined in the Victorian Transport Plan. In the 2010-11 Budget , $5.8 billion is provided for the Victorian Transport Plan to deliver new transport services and infrastructure in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, including the Regional Rail Link and the purchase of 50 new trams. The upgrade of 20 stations to premium stations will also improve Victoria's public transport system. \u2022 The Government's strong record on social policy espoused in A Fairer Victoria limited the impacts of the global financial crisis on disadvantaged Victorians. This Budget will reduce disadvantage across a wide range of areas, including protection of vulnerable children, mental health and disability services. \u2022 The 2010-11 Budget also provides $618 million TEI for major regional health projects, $4.3 billion in partnership with the Commonwealth Government for Regional Rail Link and a further $360 million for other major regional transport initiatives ahead of further new investment to be announced through a Blueprint for Regional Victoria later this year. GROWING VICTORIA TOGETHER Growing Victoria Together is the Government's vision to 2010 and beyond that outlines the Government's priorities to make Victoria a better place in which to live, work and raise a family. The Growing Victoria Together vision served the State well throughout the economic downturn with the economy proving resilient and disadvantaged Victorians being supported. Growing Victoria Together will also be an important driver of the economy in recovery and in making Victoria more sustainable while realising the economic benefits of strong population growth. The Government is committed to maintaining a strong fiscal position into the future, delivering quality services and investing in infrastructure across Victoria to achieve the Growing Victoria Together vision for: \u2022 a thriving economy; \u2022 quality health and education; \u2022 a healthy environment; \u2022 caring communities; and \u2022 a vibrant democracy. Growing Victoria Together sets out ten shared goals to achieve this vision, as outlined in Table 1.1, which are assessed against a framework of progression measures. Table 1.1: Growing Victoria Together : A vision for Victoria to 2010 and beyond Vision Goals THRIVING More quality jobs and thriving, innovative ECONOMY industries across Victoria Growing and linking all of Victoria QUALITY HEALTH AND EDUCATION High quality, accessible health and community services High quality education and training for lifelong learning Protecting the environment for HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT future generations Efficient use of natural resources CARING COMMUNITIES Building friendly, confident and safe communities A fairer society that reduces disadvantage and respects diversity VIBRANT Greater public participation and DEMOCRACY more accountable government Sound financial management This chapter provides an overview of the service delivery initiatives included in the 2010-11 Budget that support the Government's Growing Victoria Together vision. Full details of initiatives by department can be found in Appendix A. In this Budget the Government completes the funding of its election commitments outlined in Labor's Financial Statement 2006 , with a further $337 million TEI provided to take total asset investment to over $3.4 billion. Details are provided in Chapter 4 - Election commitments implementation report card. Responding to and preparing for bushfires The bushfires that occurred across Victoria in February 2009 were the most devastating in Australia's history, claiming 173 lives and destroying more than 2 000 homes and businesses. More than one year on, the recovery and reconstruction effort is progressing well in areas such as Kinglake, Marysville and Callignee. The 2009-10 Budget provided $986 million over five years for services and infrastructure to help Victoria recover from the tragedy; and since that time, the Government has announced a further $211 million over four years for reconstruction and recovery, as well as preparedness activities. This funding has supported people and communities in the reconstruction task, helped to revitalise economic activity in affected areas, and contributed to the rehabilitation of the environment. It has also addressed a number of recommendations in the August 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission Interim Report . The Government is mindful that with the expected release of the Royal Commission's final report in July, further or refocused government actions may be needed. However, the Government is making sure that critical bushfire preparedness works continue ahead of the Royal Commission's final report. Accordingly, this year's budget commits additional funding of $202 million over five years and $52 million TEI for bushfire related initiatives (listed in Appendix A). MORE QUALITY JOBS AND THRIVING, INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIES Jobs and infrastructure The global financial crisis presented challenges for all jurisdictions around the world. The Victorian economy proved resilient throughout the global financial crisis and has emerged in a strong position. Victoria was able to rely on disciplined fiscal management including its AAA credit rating, a diverse economic base, operating surpluses of more than $100 million, and prudent levels of debt, to respond to the economic downturn and the February 2009 bushfires. The Government, in partnership with the Commonwealth, acted quickly to respond to the global financial crisis, by investing in a significant infrastructure program to retain and create jobs. The benefits of this strategy are exemplified by the fact that over the past year Victoria has experienced the highest employment growth of any state, with almost 100 000 jobs created. The construction of many of the infrastructure projects announced in the 2009-10 Budget will continue this year and into the near future. This will not only help to retain jobs as the economy returns to its previous level of economic activity, but will also help to meet the needs of a growing population by delivering key services. The 2010-11 Budget builds on the strategy to invest in key infrastructure to create jobs and strengthen key services. The 2010-11 Budget will continue to focus on infrastructure with net infrastructure investment of $9.5 billion in 2010-11, including the first stages of the $4.3 billion TEI Regional Rail Link, creating and securing jobs. The Government recognises that job security is important to Victorians and can help foster equality and reduce disadvantage. The infrastructure program, funded by the Victorian Government in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, and combined with significant projects being delivered through public-private partnerships and the public non-financial corporations sector, is estimated to secure around 30 000 jobs in 2010-11 in direct construction and direct supply chain employment. Supporting Victorian businesses The global financial crisis presented challenges for all Victorian businesses. While the global outlook is improving, demand still remains subdued in many international markets. By contrast, the Australian and Victorian economies proved resilient and performed relatively strongly at a time when many global economies went into recession. The Government has actively sought to improve business competitiveness in the wake of the global financial crisis by reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and improving tax competitiveness. The Reducing the Regulatory Burden initiative has delivered a net reduction in business costs based on current initiatives of approximately $246 million. Complementing these efforts, the Government is working with the Commonwealth to implement the Seamless National Economy National Partnership to drive further reforms in areas such as regulation and competition. The top rate of land tax has been cut in five previous budgets from 5.0 per cent to the current rate of 2.25 per cent. This year, the Government is continuing to reduce business compliance costs through the development of a web-based system to streamline the payment of land transfer duty. This is in addition to the recent introduction of an online tax e-business system for the payment of payroll tax and land tax. Since 1999, the Government has also undertaken measures to reduce costs to businesses through cuts to WorkCover premiums while maintaining benefits to workers, and reducing payroll tax from 5.75 per cent to 4.95 per cent. While a decrease in revenue resulting from the global financial crisis prevented the Government from delivering tax cuts in the 2009-10 Budget , disciplined financial management and improvements in revenue projections, mean that in this Budget the Government can resume providing tax relief. The 2010-11 Budget provides a further cut to payroll tax from 4.95 per cent to 4.90 per cent, which will save around 31 000 businesses $193 million over four years. This cut will give Victoria the second lowest payroll tax rate in Australia and mean that businesses with payrolls of between $5.5 million to $18 million will pay the lowest payroll tax in Australia. In addition, WorkCover premiums will be cut by 3.5 per cent, delivering employers savings of around $60 million in 2010-11. This cut takes the average premium rate to 1.34 per cent of an employer's payroll from 1 July 2010. This is a historic low, the second lowest rate among the states, and delivers the sixth cut in seven years. It means that this Government has cut the premium rate by 40 per cent from the base since 2000-01. Active support to address the impact of the high Australian dollar During the global financial crisis, the exchange rate has been particularly volatile. The AUD/USD exchange rate fell from over 90 cents to almost 60 cents between August and October 2008, before recovering to pre-crisis levels. The strong performance of the Australian economy is now placing upward pressure on an already highly valued Australian dollar. This comes with benefits, such as downward pressure on inflation, but presents major changes for all Victorian businesses that are affected by global markets. To support Victorian businesses affected by the ongoing impacts of the global financial crisis and the high exchange rate, this Budget delivers $16 million over four years to fund: \u2022 education, training and best practice advice programs for Victorian businesses to update their knowledge of foreign exchange risk management; \u2022 support for industry organisations to better inform members of current export and foreign exchange practice and export assistance schemes; \u2022 ongoing investment attraction initiatives; and \u2022 grants to strengthen the competitiveness of key Victorian industries, including those businesses accessing global supply chains, through productivity enhancement projects. Consistent with Victoria's industry and manufacturing statement, Building Industries for our Future , the 2010-11 Budget also allocates $27 million over five years for measures designed to increase tourism to Victoria and $7.4 million over four years and $4.4 million TEI to assist the growth of the film and television industry. Small business support package While small businesses benefit from a competitive business environment, they also face many challenges and have less capacity than larger enterprises to respond to and absorb external shocks. The global financial crisis was a difficult time for many small businesses and, even as the economy recovers, many will continue to face challenges such as access to finance. In order to strengthen and continue supporting small businesses during the recovery, a $13 million package of targeted initiatives is funded in the 2010-11 Budget, which includes: \u2022 $1.6 million over two years for the Masterclass for Growth pilot program which will deliver a business development program, including business trend seminars, growth sessions and coaching, for businesses with growth potential; and \u2022 $12 million over four years to continue the Start and Run a Successful Small Business initiative, which includes Small Business Workshops, the Small Business Mentoring program, the Regional Continuity program, and Energise Enterprise which was attended by more than 38 000 people in 2009. Creating a more highly skilled workforce As the economy returns to its previous level of economic activity, demand for skilled workers is expected to increase. However, the Government is well prepared for this scenario and has invested in measures to meet the future skills needs of individuals and businesses. The Government is currently implementing Securing Jobs for your Future - Skills for Victoria , a major reform of the VET system, which will help satisfy this expected increase in demand by creating around 172 000 additional training places over four years. Securing Jobs for your Future - Skills for Victoria introduces the Victorian Training Guarantee, which will be fully implemented from January 2011, and will guarantee a training place for every Victorian who wishes to attain a higher VET qualification. Over the last ten years the Government has invested $439 million in building and upgrading Technical and Further Education (TAFE) infrastructure to meet the training needs of Victorians. In order to cater for some of the additional demand for training generated by Securing Jobs for your Future - Skills for Victoria , and to meet the expectations of students under the new system, the 2010-11 Budget provides a further $55 million TEI in TAFE infrastructure including a new Teaching and Learning Centre at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE (NMIT) Preston campus. This Budget also provides $32 million over four years towards improving the commencement and completion rates of apprentices and trainees. The Apprentice/Trainee Completion Bonus which encourages the hiring and retention of apprentices and trainees will be offered again in 2010-11. The Government will also continue the Apprentice and Trainee Accommodation Allowance, which encourages the uptake of training by offering a $25 a night accommodation allowance to those Victorians requiring temporary accommodation support to attend training, for four more years. Jobs for the Future Economy The Government recently released the Jobs for the Future Economy: Victoria's Action Plan for Green Jobs statement. The statement includes funding of $175 million over five years for 18 priority actions which will capitalise on opportunities created by recent reforms in climate change policy. Funding will stimulate new private sector investment, facilitate training for sustainability skills, fast track renewable energy projects, make government buildings more energy and water efficient and help secure thousands of jobs. The statement also includes funding to reduce the amount of litter on our streets and to assist local councils, the community and industry to adapt to increased recycling opportunities. Supporting first home buyers The retargeting of the Victorian Government's First Home Bonus in last year's budget contributed to the number of housing starts in Victoria increasing in 2009 by 10 per cent, compared to a 7.0 per cent fall for Australia as a whole. This Budget continues to provide support to first homebuyers by retargeting the First Home Bonus to provide an increase of $2 000 for newly constructed homes, taking the total first home assistance for first home buyers purchasing or building a new home in metropolitan Melbourne to $20 000. Since its introduction two years ago, the Regional First Home Bonus has enabled more Victorians to purchase their first home in regional areas, as well as supporting thousands of construction and associated jobs. More than 6 200 applicants have received the bonus and over the last six months newly constructed homes for first homebuyers in regional areas have numbered nearly 30 per cent of all newly constructed homes for first time buyers in Victoria. This Budget further enhances the Regional First Home Bonus by increasing it by $2 000, taking the bonus to $6 500 - this takes the total assistance available for first homebuyers constructing a new home in regional Victoria to $26 500. GROWING AND LINKING ALL OF VICTORIA In December 2008, the Government released its long term vision for the Victorian transport system - the $38 billion Victorian Transport Plan (VTP). The goal of the VTP is to transform Victoria's transport networks for a more liveable, productive and sustainable state. A number of VTP projects have already been completed, including the separation of road and rail at Springvale Road, Nunawading. Delivery of major transport projects including the South Morang Rail extension, electrification of the rail track between Watergardens and Sunbury, the Peninsula Link and the Geelong Ring Road will continue this year. The 2010-11 Budget provides $5.8 billion in funding for the second tranche of VTP projects to deliver new services and infrastructure including projects to be delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth. This builds on the $4.9 billion in funding provided in the 2009-10 Budget for VTP projects. Total new investment in the VTP is now more than $10 billion. Projects funded in the first two years of the VTP are set out in Appendix E. The Government's strategy to continue investing in infrastructure is reflected by the VTP and in particular the Regional Rail Link. Regional Rail Link The Victorian Government, in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, will deliver the $4.3 billion TEI Regional Rail Link project. This project will construct new, dedicated regional tracks from West Werribee to Southern Cross Station to overcome current capacity constraints. Regional Rail Link will also deliver extra capacity for suburban commuters on the Werribee, Sunbury and Craigieburn lines and allow services from Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong to run express into Melbourne. When it is completed, the Regional Rail Link will have created capacity for an extra 9 000 regional and suburban passengers every hour. Better public transport - trains and trams The 2010-11 Budget includes funding to deliver practical projects which will increase the capacity, frequency and reliability of Victorian trains and trams. Delivery of major rail projects will continue as Melbourne moves towards a more modern rail system. Funding of $804 million TEI and output funding of $3.1 million over four years will deliver 50 new trams and supporting infrastructure, including the redevelopment of the Preston Tram workshops into a tram depot. This new low-floor tram fleet will be capable of moving 10 000 people at any one time. Funding of $38 million TEI is provided to complete the program of new stations in Melbourne's growth areas. This works program, which now has total funding of $189 million TEI, will deliver new stations at Williams Landing, Lynbrook, Caroline Springs and Cardinia Road, near Pakenham. In partnership with the Commonwealth Government, $40 million TEI is provided for planning and development activities on the first stage of the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel from Dynon Road in the west to St Kilda Road at Domain. Better Roads Linking rural, regional and metropolitan Victoria Funding of $77 million has been provided for the next stage of the Geelong Ring Road, which will establish a new road link connecting stage 4B of the Geelong Ring Road with the Surf Coast Highway. It will complete the Geelong Ring Road network and establish an essential transport connection from Melbourne and regional Victoria to some of Victoria's premier tourist destinations. This will benefit freight carriers, businesses, tourism operators and local motorists. The 2010-11 Budget also provides funding for other major road programs that will improve the road network including: \u2022 $52 million TEI for better regional roads; \u2022 $25 million for a program to replace incandescent traffic lights with light emitting diode technology which will deliver environmental and safety benefits for road users, as announced in the Jobs for the Future Economy: Victoria's Action Plan for Green Jobs statement; and \u2022 $23 million over four years to repair and maintain Victoria's road infrastructure. In partnership with the Commonwealth, the Government will commence the duplication of Clyde Road at Berwick and the upgrade of the Princes Highway between Traralgon and Sale. These two major road projects with a total TEI of $231 million will be funded under the Nation Building (formerly AusLink II) program. In addition, contracts have been signed to deliver the Peninsula Link under an Availability Public Private Partnership model. The project will deliver faster travel times for people travelling to and from the Mornington Peninsula and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Moving around Melbourne The 2010-11 Budget includes funding for a number of initiatives which will assist in the movement of people using the road network in the greater Melbourne area. The Outer Suburban Arterial Roads program will provide $67 million TEI to improve the capacity and safety of roads in outer metropolitan Melbourne, including Hallam Road which will be duplicated between Pound Road and Ormond Road at a cost of $35 million TEI. Facilitating economic growth The 2010-11 Budget builds on the State's objective to grow the economy by supporting private sector growth and new jobs by developing the most efficient and effective transport links to connect people to jobs and goods to market. Initiatives include: \u2022 $11 million TEI for planning and investigation activities for the Truck Action Plan; \u2022 $5 million TEI for a road upgrade package, and to trial high productivity freight vehicles, which will benefit Victoria's green triangle region in south west Victoria; and \u2022 $40 million TEI, in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, to scope and implement works at the metropolitan freight terminals at Dandenong and Somerton. Planning for a growing Victoria The Government is providing funding of $14 million in the 2010-11 Budget to advance planning for the long-term sustainability and liveability of Victorian communities. Initiatives such as the Expert Assistance Program and the collection of detailed housing development and spatial employment projections for metropolitan areas, will enable land to be developed and to ensure that key information is accessible. These initiatives aim to cater for Victoria's needs arising from a growing population, and demand for jobs, services and infrastructure close to where people live and work. The Government has identified Central Activity Districts and other priority metropolitan and regional locations to provide for Victoria's housing, job and community needs. The 2010-11 Budget provides funding for strategic development initiatives, including: \u2022 $10 million over four years to facilitate development in Central Activity Districts and employment corridors, as identified in the Government's planning update, Melbourne @ 5 million ; \u2022 $9.5 million TEI to construct a large-scale mixed use facility within the Footscray station precinct that will support existing government investment and encourage ongoing development in the Footscray Central Activity District; and \u2022 $2.6 million to continue the implementation of priority actions consistent with Victoria's Heritage: Strengthening our communities. HIGH QUALITY, ACCESSIBLE HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES The 2010-11 Budget is accompanied by Putting Patients First (Budget Information Paper No. 2) which reflects the agreement on health and hospitals reform between the Commonwealth Government and all Australian states and territories - other than Western Australia - reached on 20 April 2010. Putting patients first Under the historic Agreement on health and hospitals reform, $935 million of additional Commonwealth funding will be provided over the next four years for a range of health and hospital services. While the Agreement will deliver additional funding to Victoria, the Government is committed to maintaining its level of investment in this Budget and into the future. Accordingly, the 2010-11 Budget will see the Government invest $760 million in hospitals services and $1.2 billion TEI in health care infrastructure. In total this year's Budget provides $4 billion to be invested in health and hospital services and capital improvements, including Victorian State Budget funding and funding announced through the Agreement on health and hospitals reform. This funding will help support the Victorian health system to respond to increasing demand for services. Putting Patients First Budget Information Paper No. 2 can be viewed at www.budget.vic.gov.au. Investing in the health of all Victorians The Government is committed to making high-quality health and community services accessible to all Victorians. Since 1999, recurrent funding for health and aged care services has increased by 130 per cent, from around $5 billion to over $11 billion in 2009-10. This government investment has expanded the capacity of hospitals, which this year will provide over 733 000 more treatments than in 1999. The 2010-11 Budget delivers another major boost for Victoria's health system, providing a $760 million increase in funding for hospitals over five years. Growth in hospital services The 2010-11 Budget commits $610 million over five years for the Growth in Hospital Services initiative to create extra capacity to meet growing demand for hospital services. Key initiatives include: \u2022 $276 million over four years to expand inpatient services including critical care, and maternity services to treat an additional 22 000 patients in 2010-11; \u2022 $64 million over four years to meet demand for medical services such as renal dialysis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and blood services; \u2022 $44 million over four years to provide the right care in the right place for Victorian patients; \u2022 $39 million over four years for an additional 50 000 emergency presentations at hospitals in 2010-11; \u2022 $32 million over four years for new sub-acute services including geriatric emergency management and rehabilitation services; \u2022 $32 million over four years to provide an additional 32 000 outpatient appointments in 2010-11; \u2022 $11 million over four years to expand the Victorian Patient Transport Assistance Scheme to help rural patients access services in metropolitan Melbourne; \u2022 $8.3 million over four years to commission a new cardiac catheterisation laboratory in Ballarat; \u2022 $46 million over four years for new mental health inpatient services, including 33 new adult inpatient beds at Geelong and Northern Health, and 20 Youth Prevention Emergency Recovery Service beds; and \u2022 $45 million to provide 9 000 patients with their elective surgery more quickly. An additional $150 million is provided over three years to support public hospitals to make the health system more effective, invest in clinical practice improvements and drive innovation in hospitals. A significant investment in health care facilities Investment in new and upgraded hospital, community health and aged care facilities continues to be a priority for the Government. Between 1999 and the 2009-10 Budget , $5.2 billion was committed to build or refurbish hospitals and aged care facilities to meet the needs of a growing population and an increase in the aged demographic. In this Budget the Government is allocating a further $1.2 billion TEI to hospitals, aged care and community health facilities, including $618 million TEI in regional Victoria. This takes total investment in Victorian health infrastructure since the 2009-10 Budget to $2.3 billion TEI. Regional health care facilities The Government recognises the importance of providing high quality health care to all Victorians no matter where they live. Investment in regional health care facilities of $618 million in the 2010-11 Budget will mean that many Victorians will gain access to improved health care facilities in close proximity to their homes. This is highlighted in the 2010-11 Budget by the announcement of $473 million TEI for the new Bendigo Hospital. The new Bendigo Hospital will be the largest regional hospital project ever undertaken in Victoria and will improve access to services and expand physical capacity to meet current and future demand. In addition to the new Bendigo Hospital, the 2010-11 Budget also includes funding of $142 million TEI for other regional hospital and community health infrastructure. Funding provided includes: \u2022 $55 million TEI for the Regional Integrated Care Centre at Ballarat Health Service, which will be co-funded by the Commonwealth, to increase capacity so that more than 800 additional patients can receive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment locally; \u2022 $34 million TEI to increase acute capacity at the Geelong Hospital through the construction of a new acute wing, and for the planning and purchase of land for a new stand alone community hospital to address demand in Geelong's southern suburbs and the Surf Coast; \u2022 $26 million TEI to co-locate aged care and acute facilities at Coleraine Hospital; \u2022 $25 million TEI for Stage 2 of the Leongatha Hospital Redevelopment, following a $10 million investment in Stage 1; and \u2022 $3 million TEI to upgrade the Healesville Hospital and undertake works to enable the expansion and reconfiguration of services. Improving the lives of cancer patients Cancer is the leading cause of death in Victoria, affecting one in three Victorians aged up to 75. In response, the Government is continuing to implement the $150 million Victoria's Cancer Action Plan 2008-2011, which aims to improve the cancer survival rate of Victorians by 10 per cent by 2015. In addition, the Government has made a number of commitments to initiatives that will support the plan including the $1 billion TEI Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre which is being funded in partnership with the Commonwealth. In the 2010-11 Budget , the Government is providing funding towards redeveloping the Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre. As well as enhancing radiotherapy and chemotherapy capacity, a range of other services including research will be integrated to help deliver better patient outcomes. The Government is also providing $40 million TEI and $29 million over three years for the next stage of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre, including constructing the palliative care unit and acute wards, and creating additional research space. This takes total investment in the project to $144 million. Continuing investment in metropolitan health care facilities In December 2009, the Government announced funding of $408 million TEI for the Box Hill Hospital redevelopment - the single largest suburban health infrastructure project undertaken in Victoria. This project will transform Box Hill Hospital into a modern health care facility that will boast a significantly larger emergency department and care for around 7 000 additional patients a year. The 2010-11 Budget also sees the final funding allocation for the Sunshine Hospital redevelopment and expansion. The $91 million TEI commitment in this Budget will take total investment in the project to $184 million TEI and enable significant expansion of services to better accommodate the needs of people living in the western suburbs of Melbourne and to meet forecast population growth. In addition, the Government will fund the expansion or redevelopment of a number of other metropolitan health care facilities including: \u2022 $11 million TEI for expanded paediatric services at the Monash Medical Centre; \u2022 $10 million TEI for the redevelopment of allied health facilities at the Royal Melbourne Hospital's city campus; \u2022 $9.1 million TEI to relocate the Monashlink Community Health Service to a purpose built facility in Glen Waverley; and \u2022 $7.4 million TEI to expand cardiac catheterisation services at the Northern Hospital. Improving access to dental care Providing public dental services to children and disadvantaged adults is a priority for the Government. Since 2004-05 the Government has committed $155 million towards improving the oral health of Victorians. In the 2010-11 Budget , the Government will provide $20 million over four years to meet growing demand and deliver improved dental services at Melton and Mildura. The funding will enable around 12 000 eligible clients to be treated annually and support the training of additional dental clinicians. Supporting seniors Victorian seniors have an important role to play in society and the Government is committed to giving them every opportunity to continue to live independently within their communities. The 2010-11 Budget provides $71 million over five years and $2.5 million TEI to improve the lives of seniors through a number of measures, including: \u2022 $67 million over five years to improve the sustainability of community based services to support older people by providing additional funding, in partnership with the Commonwealth, to Home and Community Care (HACC) services; \u2022 $2.8 million over four years to upgrade the Seniors Card website; \u2022 $2.5 million TEI for the fifth stage of the Aged Care Land Bank which provides land for not-for-profit aged care providers to develop residential aged care services in the inner and middle suburbs of Melbourne; and \u2022 $1.2 million over two years to purchase 1 000 Personal Alert Victoria units to assist older people live independently. The Government will also extend the current land tax exemption for retirement villages, residential care facilities, supported residential services and residential services for people with disabilities to include the construction phase of these facilities. This extension of the land tax exemption will reduce the cost of developing these facilities helping to improve affordability for seniors requiring these services. Prevention and early intervention Prevention of chronic disease is a priority for the Government as it helps reduce pressures on the health system and the burden of disease on the community. While Victoria is working in partnership with the Commonwealth to implement the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, the Government acknowledges that there is still more that needs to be done. Accordingly, this Budget provides funding to support the prevention of avoidable disease and the early identification and treatment of chronic disease through measures listed in Appendix A. HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR LIFELONG LEARNING Providing a high quality education Education is a key priority for the Government. The 2010-11 Budget builds on the investment of previous budgets, with a focus on addressing ongoing challenges, enhancing existing capacity in educational performance, and addressing disadvantage to ensure all Victorian students have access to high quality learning and teaching. All this is occurring in an environment where a significant level of investment is being made in the infrastructure of Victorian schools. Investing in Victorian Government schools The 2010-11 Budget provides a $381 million TEI in schools, which completes the Labor's Financial Statement 2006 commitment of $1.9 billion to the Victorian Schools Plan. The funding in the 2010-11 Budget will ensure that 553 schools will have been funded to be rebuilt, renovated or extended over the past four years, which is significantly more than the Labor's Financial Statement 2006 commitment to fund school capital works in 500 schools. This means that more Victorian students are receiving the immediate benefits of high quality school infrastructure, which is critical to delivering excellent educational outcomes. Alongside the Victorian Schools Plan, the Government continues to deliver projects as part of the Building the Education Revolution program, which will significantly improve facilities in 1 300 Victorian Government schools. This means the combined Victorian Schools Plan and the Building the Education Revolution has seen a record 1 437 schools receive capital works since 2006. This Budget will provide: \u2022 $162 million TEI for regeneration projects, including Altona/Bayside; Bendigo; Corio Norlane; Heidelberg; Keysborough/Springvale; Knox; Ouyen; Thomastown; and Western Heights; \u2022 $81 million TEI for 18 modernisation projects; \u2022 $41 million TEI to ensure that schools identified in high risk areas receive capital works to improve their resistance to a bushfire attack and meet new construction standards; \u2022 $34 million TEI to start construction at Tarneit 10-12 and for continued work on Timbarra P-9; Mount Ridley P-12 College; and Manor Lakes P-12 Specialist College; \u2022 $33 million TEI for school improvement programs (as announced in the 2009-10 Budget Update ); \u2022 $11 million TEI to secure the future of small rural schools; \u2022 $4 million TEI for a replacement school at the Glenroy Specialist School; and \u2022 $1.5 million TEI for fire reinstatement at Toolamba Primary School. The Government's investment is on top of the $2.6 billion in funding provided through the Commonwealth Government's Building the Education Revolution . The Victorian and Commonwealth Governments have worked together over the last year to ensure that the investments provided through the Building the Education Revolution and the Victorian Schools Plan are used collaboratively so that the opportunities provided to schools are maximised. Giving children the best start The Government has made significant investment in early childhood development in recognition of the economic and social benefits this can have later in life. The Government is currently implementing the Blueprint for Education and Early Childhood Development and has responded to increased demand for maternal and child health services. While the birth rate remains strong, there will be pressure on early childhood services as demand increases. In response, the Government is making a further investment in the 2010-11 Budget to ensure Victorian families can access the services they need. The 2010-11 Budget provides $191 million over five years for early childhood development initiatives and to support students who are most in need. The 2010-11 Budget provides a range of new funding that underlines its commitment to early childhood development. This includes: \u2022 $63 million over five years towards additional demand growth in kindergartens which will ensure that sufficient places are funded and that Victoria maintains its current high participation rate; \u2022 $38 million over four years to allow for a significant increase in the intensity of intervention, and associated support, provided by Early Childhood Intervention Services; \u2022 $14 million in 2010-11 to extend the Government's investment in integrated children's centres and boost funding to renovate, refurbish and upgrade existing community based children's services; and \u2022 $3.5 million over four years to provide funding for the next steps in implementing Victoria's early childhood workforce strategy. Supporting students who are most in need The Government is committed to fostering an inclusive early years and schooling system that values diversity and meets the needs of all children and young people. The vision is that all Victorian children and young people with a disability or developmental delay will actively participate, enjoy and learn alongside their peers in education and care settings while preparing for an active adulthood. In recognition of this, the 2010-11 Budget provides: \u2022 $57 million over four years for additional demand growth and transport needs in the Program for Students with Disabilities. This increase in funding will continue to ensure that student achievement in education and learning is maximised and that students with disabilities are valued and participate in all aspects of school life; \u2022 $43 million TEI for major upgrades to schools and facilities for students with disability or developmental delay, including $18 million TEI to upgrade and build new facilities at the Northern School for Autism and the Eastern Autistic School; \u2022 $7.5 million over four years and $1.7 million TEI to establish the Victorian Deaf Education Institute to help build the knowledge, skill and workforce capacity of professionals working with deaf and hard of hearing children; and \u2022 $4.4 million TEI to provide satellite units for students with an intellectual disability and inclusion support programs for students with autism within mainstream schools. The Government is also providing $1.7 million to assist in closing the education gap for Indigenous students by establishing football academies for Indigenous boys, as well as providing dance academies for Indigenous girls. These academies will help to attract young Indigenous people back to school, engage them while they finish their studies, and assist them with the transition from school into the next phase of their lives. Since the 2009-10 Budget , the Government has provided additional funding of $200 million over four years to support non-government schools. A particular focus of this funding is to improve educational opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and target funding towards students with disabilities. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS Protecting the environment and upgrading parks The Government is committed to continuing to protect Victoria's natural resources and improving the visitor experience in all of Victoria's national parks and metropolitan parks. To make parks more accessible, from 1 July 2010, entry will be free of charge at parks including Wilsons Promontory, Mount Buffalo, Baw Baw, Mornington Peninsula, Yarra Ranges (Mount Donna Buang) and Point Nepean as well as Werribee Park, Coolart, National Rhododendron Gardens and William Ricketts Sanctuary metropolitan parks. In the 2010-11 Budget , the Government will provide $13 million over four years and $22 million TEI to protect the environment and to support major Victorian tourism areas including: \u2022 $11 million TEI and $1.3 million over two years for remedial works to the Southern Training Wall of the Hume Dam located to the east of Albury-Wodonga and for an additional Victorian contribution towards the operating costs of the Murray Darling Basin Authority; \u2022 $11 million TEI and $2.0 million in 2010-11 for free entry to Victoria's national and metropolitan parks and to upgrade or renew facilities in 15 metropolitan and regional state parks. Works include the construction of the Gipps Street-Clark Street bridge, Main Yarra Trail bridge, the Darebin shared pathway, and the replacement of walking trails, viewing platforms, boardwalks, staircases and visitor facilities; and \u2022 $6 million over four years to tackle weeds and pests on public and private land. EFFICIENT USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES Securing our Natural Future - a white paper for land and biodiversity at a time of climate change Governments around the world are focusing on both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. Victoria's Land and Biodiversity White Paper - Securing Our Natural Future sets out a new framework for action that will significantly change the way Victoria's natural resources are managed. The Government will make its natural resource institutions more flexible and better able to deal with environmental programs and ensure that the regulatory structure supports private investment in biodiversity and ecosystem services. The Government has provided a $105 million package of initiatives for the Land and Biodiversity White Paper including: \u2022 $19 million over three years from the Natural Resource Investment Program, bringing the Government's total commitment to $85 million over three years for the Land and Biodiversity White Paper, to protect 13 flagship areas across Victoria and to improve connectivity through a network of biolinks areas which allow plants and animals to disperse and recolonise; \u2022 $15 million over four years for land health programs to develop and integrate social, economic and environmental research knowledge, planning methods, interventions and tools to support landscape resilience; and \u2022 $4 million over four years for institutional change to restructure the present ten Catchment Management Authorities, three Regional Coastal Boards, Melbourne Water and the Gippsland Lakes Taskforce into five Natural Resource and Catchment Authorities. Responding to climate change The Government has consistently shown leadership on climate change, including hosting the Garnaut Review and committing to support a national emissions trading scheme. The release of the Climate Change Green Paper further illustrates the Government's commitment. The Green Paper provides an analysis of the issues and impacts on the State from climate change and includes options for Victoria to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change and become a leading low carbon economy. Following public consultation, a White Paper will be released later in 2010, which will outline Victoria's climate change policy. A Climate Change Bill will be introduced to give effect to the policies announced. BUILDING FRIENDLY, CONFIDENT AND SAFE COMMUNITIES Victorians value friendly, confident and safe communities and the Government is committed to ensuring Victorians feel safe and connected to their community. The 2010-11 Budget provides a range of initiatives to improve public safety and the justice system. Keeping Victorians safe While Victoria's crime rate has decreased by 25.5 per cent per 100 000 population since 1999-00, the Government recognises there is concern in the community in relation to violent crime and anti-social behaviour. In response, the Government is implementing a number of initiatives to make the community safer, including the biggest single one-off boost to police numbers in Victorian history. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing community safety concerns, particularly alcohol related violence and assaults. Just prior to the budget, the Government announced that it would deliver an additional 1 966 officers to front line policing by June 2015. To help meet this commitment, the 2010-11 Budget includes: \u2022 $561 million over five years for an additional 1 700 net additional sworn police by June 2015. These additional police will be recruited and trained in the Victoria Police academy and add to the 1 920 additional police the Government has committed to recruiting since it came to office; \u2022 $74 million over four years to recruit an additional 200 unsworn Victorian public service staff for Victoria Police, that will free up 200 sworn police officers to be redeployed to front line roles; and \u2022 $37 million over four years and $1.4 million TEI to consolidate police call-taking and dispatch in country areas as part of the Government's modernisation of emergency response. This will release a further 66 sworn police officers for redeployment to front line duties. The Government is also looking to work with vulnerable young people to tackle knife crime on our streets. This Budget will provide $22 million over four years for 55 additional youth workers across the State as part of the Government's Respect Agenda to support vulnerable young people engaging in risky behaviour and to tackle the knife culture on Victorian streets. Since 2000-01, the Government has committed in excess of $450 million to fund the construction or refurbishment of more than 160 police stations and residences. The 2010-11 Budget adds to these police station improvements by providing $9.3 million TEI and $0.5 million over four years. In addition to new police stations, the 2010-11 Budget includes $81 million TEI and $18 million over four years to improve accommodation for Victoria Police. This project will involve reorganising operational accommodation in Melbourne's central business district (CBD) and relocating the Melbourne West police station to an alterative CBD location. To improve safety for public transport users, funding of $29 million over four years and $55 million TEI is provided to upgrade 20 railway stations to premium stations, including the recruitment of 100 station staff. This will increase the number of premium stations on the metropolitan network to 96, representing 45 per cent of stations. Improving road safety Under its road safety strategy, arrive alive 2008-2017 , the Government aims to save an estimated 100 extra lives and prevent around 2 000 serious injuries per year by the end of 2017. The 2010-11 Budget provides an additional $16 million over four years and $0.7 million TEI to introduce automated number plate recognition technology. The funding provides additional resources to Victoria Police and the Sheriff's Office to purchase and operate the technology, as well as additional resources for the Magistrates Court, and the Community Corrections system to deal with the anticipated impact of introducing the technology on the broader justice system. Giving Victorians greater access to justice Victoria's courts and tribunals are a key part of the justice system, and contribute to the fostering of friendly, confident and safe communities. The 2010-11 Budget provides an additional $136 million over four years and $5.5 million TEI to improve access to justice for Victorians. Initiatives funded in the 2010-11 Budget include: \u2022 $50 million over two years to meet growth in the demand for services offered by Victoria Legal Aid, including legal representation and duty lawyer services for disadvantaged Victorians who are unable to afford legal assistance; \u2022 $60 million over four years and $4.5 million TEI to enhance the capacity of Victoria's court system across jurisdictions by providing additional judges and courtroom resources to further reduce court delays; and develop a Legal Services Masterplan to provide a long term strategy to bring together the range of courts and legal services used by the Victorian community; \u2022 $11 million over four years and $0.6 million TEI to help reduce delays in the Children's Court by encouraging a less adversarial approach through a mediation model and modifying the configuration of two existing court facilities, so that they are more suitable and reduce stress to the court users involved in this process; and \u2022 $4 million over four years to implement the new personal safety intervention order, which aims to divert non-dangerous matters to mediation instead of courts. In addition, the 2010-11 Budget provides funding of $12 million over four years and $0.4 million TEI to expand specialist sexual assault response centres in Frankston and Mildura, and to establish a new centre in Geelong. These centres will co-locate specialist police investigators with child protection workers and sexual assault counsellors with strong links to specialist forensic medical personnel, to provide an integrated and holistic response to sexual assault victims. Corrections The 2010-11 Budget provides $103 million over four years and $50 million TEI for further prison extensions for both the men's and women's corrections systems. These extensions are required to respond to Victoria's growing prison population, in line with general population trends and the government's focus on law and order. The 2010-11 Budget provides funding for: \u2022 $59 million over four years and $22 million TEI to effectively manage the women's prison system, including expanding the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Deer Park and expanding the Tarrengower Prison in Maldon; \u2022 $18 million over four years and $28 million TEI to effectively manage the men's prison system by providing an additional 85 permanent beds; and \u2022 $26 million over four years for the Better Pathways strategy, which provides programs and services that aim to address women's offending and re-offending, including housing and employment programs, counselling and mental health treatment. Multiculturalism and the arts Building on previous investment in redeveloping Lygon Street, Lonsdale Street and Little Bourke Street, the 2010-11 Budget provides $12 million over four years for a cultural precincts and community infrastructure fund. The fund will enable the construction of new and enhancement of existing community spaces and facilities within identified cultural precincts. As was the case with the completed redevelopments, it is expected the fund will leverage additional contributions from local government and the community to enhance a number of precincts across Victoria. In celebration of the National Gallery of Victoria's 150th anniversary in 2011, the Budget provides $3.1 million TEI and $0.8 million over four years to install a purpose built gallery for children and exhibition space to present the Asian collection. The State Library of Victoria will receive $2.4 million over two years to maintain community services and online access, and to manage growth in demand from the general public, young people, international students and cultural visitors. The 2010-11 Budget also provides $7.5 million TEI to upgrade Scienceworks and undertake remedial works to the adjacent land. Based in Melbourne, Circus Oz is Australia's pre-eminent contemporary circus. This Budget provides funding of $3 million TEI to design a new, purpose built operational facility for Circus Oz. Sport and recreation The 2010-11 Budget provides continued support for sport and recreation at all levels across Victoria, with substantial investment in the development and maintenance of elite facilities for major sporting events, and provision of grants and sporting infrastructure to local councils to encourage communities to engage in sport and adapt to the effects of climate change. Initiatives include: \u2022 $30 million over two years and $6 million TEI to refurbish the Southern Stand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and to undertake irrigation and landscaping works in Yarra Park; \u2022 $4 million over two years for the Sustainable Sports Grounds program which will assist local councils to mitigate the impact of the drought on community sport and recreation grounds; \u2022 $12 million TEI and $0.2 million in 2010-11 for the purchase of land and design of a new multidiscipline State Shooting Centre; and \u2022 $14 million to assist councils and community groups with improvements to community sport and recreation facilities. Securing the future of the Australian Open in Melbourne The Government is undertaking a major redevelopment of the Melbourne and Olympic Park precinct to consolidate Melbourne's reputation as a world-class sporting destination. The 2010-11 Budget provides funding of $363 million TEI for the first stage of the redevelopment which will ensure that the Australian Open grand slam tennis event remains in Melbourne until at least 2036. Works during Stage 1 will include fully enclosing Margaret Court Arena, refurbishing Rod Laver arena, and building eight new indoor courts and 13 outdoor courts. Promoting respect The establishment of a new portfolio and the appointment of a Minister for the Respect Agenda earlier this year reflected the Government's commitment to promoting respectful behaviour. The 2010-11 Budget provides funding of: \u2022 $14 million over four years to implement the first phase of the A Right to Respect: Victoria's Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women with a focus on delivering an integrated approach across a range of settings such as work, sport, education, community and the media; \u2022 $1.7 million over three years for a range of activities, including funding for partnership projects that promote respect and community engagement; \u2022 $0.6 million over two years to implement a campaign promoting the new Sport Code of Conduct; and \u2022 $1 million in 2010-11 to the Victorian Multicultural Commission Community Grants program for community projects which promote social cohesion and community harmony. A FAIRER SOCIETY - REDUCING DISADVANTAGE AND RESPECTING DIVERSITY The Government remains committed to reducing disadvantage and ensuring that all Victorians have the opportunity, capability and support to lead active and fulfilling lives. Over the past five years more than $5 billion has been invested through A Fairer Victoria , with a strong focus on getting the best start in life, improving educational and work opportunities, improving health and wellbeing and developing more liveable communities that are safe and cohesive. The 2010-11 Budget provides funding for a range of measures which will increase access to universal services, reduce barriers to opportunity, and provide support for disadvantaged groups and places of high need. Sustaining support for vulnerable children Support for vulnerable children is of paramount importance to the Victorian Government. This was illustrated by a $135 million investment in the 2009-10 Budget to enable Out of Home Care services to better support children who are unable to live with their parents or extended family. The 2010-11 Budget will fund a range of measures to further enhance the quality and robustness of the assistance provided to vulnerable children and their families. Funding of $42 million will: \u2022 increase the sustainability of the Out of Home Care placement system for children removed from their families by addressing recent growth, including culturally sensitive assistance for Aboriginal Kinship Care; \u2022 improve retention in the child protection workforce, and provide an early childhood development worker in each of the 24 ChildFIRST catchments; and \u2022 enhance the Office of the Child Safety Commissioner's capacity to undertake independent reviews and scrutiny of child protection practices, thus improving the monitoring and accountability of child protection practice. These measures will complement the $77 million in funding for four years, which was announced in September 2009, to increase the capacity of child protection and family services by hiring additional frontline child protection workers, establishing a specialist intervention team to tackle child protection hot spots and supporting children placed with their extended family. The Government will also provide $24 million over four years to strengthen the capacity of family services so community sector organisations can continue to provide services to vulnerable children, young people and families in line with their increased statutory responsibilities under the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 . Continuing mental health reform The Government continues its focus on promoting good mental health and supporting the treatment and recovery of those who experience mental health conditions. The 2010-11 Budget provides new investment to continue implementing the Because Mental Health Matters: Victorian Mental Health Reform Strategy 2009-2019 . Funding of $59 million over four years is allocated to measures focused on early intervention and effective and coordinated health and social care that will enable people with mental health conditions to lead fulfilling lives. Key initiatives include: \u2022 $14 million over four years to provide increased support for young people experiencing mental health conditions; \u2022 $4.9 million over four years to provide increased support for older people experiencing mental health conditions; and \u2022 $2.7 million over four years to complete the statewide rollout of an enhanced triage referral service including a follow up service that ensures people seeking assistance have accessed appropriate care. In addition, $46 million over four years has been provided for new mental health inpatient services as part of the Growth in Hospital Services initiative. The Budget also provides infrastructure funding to support mental health patients including the $14 million TEI 22 bed Austin Health community care unit at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital and 75 mental health beds for the new Bendigo hospital. In anticipation of the Mental Health Bill 2010 being passed by Parliament, $37 million over four years is provided in this Budget to prepare for, and introduce, systemic reforms required to manage compulsory mental health care. The funding will improve the management of compulsory orders and achieve required safeguards compatible with the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities together with improved health and social outcomes for clients and families. Strong economic pathways for Aboriginal Victorians In 2010-11 the Government is working to deliver on its commitments, through COAG, to halve the gap in indigenous employment outcomes over the next decade. In 2009 the Government established the Victorian Aboriginal Economic Development Group (VAED Group) which has prepared the report Moonda Wurrin Gree - Pathways To A Better Economic Future . The report has identified the need for a changed approach as well as key areas where more action and sustained effort across the public, private and philanthropic sectors will make a difference to the economic circumstances of Indigenous people. The report and the Government's response to its recommendations will be released in the near future. Strengthening Indigenous communities The Government recognises that strong communities are the foundation for good health and well-being, and investments in building the capacity of indigenous communities will contribute to closing the gap. The 2010-11 Budget will provide: \u2022 $2.3 million over two years for initiatives that enhance indigenous leadership and encourage young indigenous people to step into future leadership roles; \u2022 $3.6 million over four years to build the skills of Registered Aboriginal Parties to enable them to fulfil their obligations under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 and effectively protect their communities' heritage; and \u2022 $1.0 million over four years to support the residents of Lake Tyers and Framlingham (Victoria's only two discrete indigenous communities) to govern their communities. Affordable, accessible and sustainable homes The Government is currently implementing a substantial social housing program in partnership with the Commonwealth. Under the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan , $1.3 billion is being provided to construct more than 4 500 social housing dwellings and deliver improvements to existing dwellings. To date, 300 social housing dwellings have been completed, and 2900 dwellings are underway. All Nation Building and Jobs Plan funded social housing projects are expected to be completed by 2012. In March 2010 the Government released Affordable, Accessible and Sustainable Homes - the Victorian Integrated Housing Strategy . The centrepiece of the strategy is a commitment by the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments to deliver a $177 million incentive package to the private sector to build 4 500 new private rental homes in Victoria for low to moderate income families as part of the National Affordability Rental Scheme. Disability reform program The Government is providing an integrated, multi-year program of investment ($59 million over four years and $11 million TEI) to continue reform in disability services through individual and family capacity building, and investment in accommodation linked to support for people with a disability. The range of investments will achieve a better match between the diverse and increasingly complex nature of support needs and the range of support options available to meet those needs. Investments for improved support include: \u2022 $22 million over four years to help the community sector meet increased costs associated with high need clients in shared support accommodation; \u2022 $13 million over four years, plus $11 million TEI to provide an extra 20 places in shared supported accommodation for people with high needs and 15 additional places in facility based respite; \u2022 $8.3 million over four years to improve access to aids and equipment for people with a disability; \u2022 $7.9 million over four years to provide additional individual support packages; and \u2022 $7.5 million over four years to improve access to services and coordination of support for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder. These initiatives will be complemented by the Government's increased support for students with a disability which is discussed in Chapter 1 under the High Quality Education and Training for Lifelong Learning section. Helping low income Victorians with the rising cost of water The Government recognises that the affordability of utilities is a cause of stress for some Victorians. In 2009-10 the Government expects to spend $1.3 billion on concessions to help low-income earners meet the cost of living, including more than $100 million for water and sewerage concessions. In this Budget, the Government is raising the water and sewerage concession cap in 2010-11, at a cost of $52 million over four years, to minimise the impact on low-income households. The 2010-11 Budget also provides $4.0 million to extend the WaterWise program for two more years, providing over 9 000 low income households with audits and retrofits. This will help low income households to use water more efficiently and reduce their bills. Enhancing the liveability of communities The Government recognises that enhancing the amenities and liveability of our communities contributes to improved outcomes for all Victorians. The 2010-11 Budget will provide a range of measures that build on recent investments towards this objective including: \u2022 $23 million over four years for the Transport Connections Program to extend 32 local projects in rural and regional Victoria which have been mapping local resources and developing transport solutions to specific local problems; \u2022 $22 million towards the cost of new and upgraded community infrastructure such as libraries, community centres and local sporting facilities to enable people to better participate in community life and make connections with others in their community, particularly in growth areas; and \u2022 $2.2 million to start to address the disadvantage in the Corio-Norlane region, by providing for a range of transport improvement projects. GREATER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT Accountability The Victorian Auditor-General's Office provides assurance to the Victorian Parliament on accountability and performance of Victorian public sector agencies and authorities. The role of the Victorian Auditor-General's Office has become increasingly complex, with changing methods of delivery and expansion of Government services. In recognition of this, the 2010-11 Budget provides $5.5 million over four years for the Victorian Auditor-General's Office to assist the Auditor-General provide financial and performance audits of Victorian public sector agencies and authorities. In addition, Section 19 of the Audit Act 1994 legislates that an independent auditor must conduct a performance audit of the Victorian Auditor-General's Office every three years. The 2010-11 Budget provides $0.3 million over two years to the Parliament for this purpose. SOUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Government has a strong track record in managing the State's finances since coming to office. Every year the Government has delivered on its commitment to produce an operating surplus of at least $100 million and maintain prudent debt levels. This disciplined fiscal management ensured that the Victoria economy remained resilient during the global economic downtown and is well positioned to face any future economic challenges. Maintaining Victoria's AAA credit rating The Government has maintained Victoria's AAA credit rating, despite challenging economic conditions. This was achieved through responsible investments and management of the State's assets. The Government is committed to maintaining strong, sustainable finances, as well as a level of borrowings that is consistent with Victoria's AAA rating. The ratings agencies use a variety of measures when examining the credit worthiness of states, or more specifically in rating the securities issued by them. This includes both net debt and net financial liabilities of the general government sector and the non-financial public sector which are measures of overall indebtedness. They also look at the capacity of jurisdictions to service the obligations arising from these measures. Maintaining a AAA credit rating is important to Victoria's prosperity as it allows continued investment in critical infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and transport across all of Victoria, while minimising the cost of borrowing."

Importantly, this cycle aims to ensure that the outputs (or goods and services) government provides, such as health and hospital care, education, roads, public transport, police, and cultural institutions, are aligned with and contribute to the achievement of the Government's desired outcomes for the community. Through the 2010-11 Budget , the Government will continue to invest in outputs designed to contribute to the achievement of GVT outcomes, including the key priorities of securing more jobs and a competitive Victorian economy, maintaining Victoria's liveability, bushfire reconstruction and recovery, and the continued delivery of high quality services. Chapter 1 Service and Budget Strategies provided an overview of the service delivery initiatives included in the 2010-11 Budget that support the Government's GVT vision. This chapter highlights some of the Government's past service delivery achievements, present challenges and key Government responses, and broadly outlines the mix of outputs that it expects will best contribute to the achievement of GVT outcomes. Chapter 3 Departmental Output Statements details all outputs, under output groups, to be delivered in the budget year, including associated performance measures of quantity, quality, timeliness and cost. Appendix B Growing Victoria Together Progress Report provides a full report on all GVT measures of progress. THRIVING ECONOMY The significance of a thriving economy A thriving and fair economy enables government to provide the services and infrastructure that Victorians expect and helps to make Victoria a great place to live, work and raise a family. A strong economy is built upon a competitive and adaptive industry base, a growing population that brings diversity to cities and regions, and transport and communications infrastructure that links people and businesses throughout Victoria, Australia and the world. Victoria's strong economic record has been supported by a combination of sound financial management, significant strategic infrastructure investment, a focus on skills training and a competitive business environment. These building blocks for growth have helped to sustain employment and moderate the effect of the global economic downturn, and they remain a priority for Victoria. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE More quality jobs and thriving, innovative industries across Victoria Over recent years the Government has invested in achieving more quality jobs and thriving, innovative industries across Victoria by: \u2022 encouraging business growth through prudent economic management, including cuts to payroll tax from the 2000 rate of 5.75 per cent to the new rate of 4.9 per cent announced in this budget; cuts to the top land tax rate by more than half from 5 per cent in 1999 to 2.25 per cent, and increasing land tax thresholds so that land holdings at a range of values fall into lower land tax brackets; \u2022 improving Victoria's competitiveness and productivity by removing unnecessary regulatory burdens, saving business more than $240 million per annum based on current initiatives; \u2022 delivering savings to Victorian employers through a series of cuts to WorkCover premiums, including a further cut of 3.5 per cent in 2010-11 that will save Victorian employers approximately $60 million; \u2022 sustaining economic and industry development in regional Victoria by investing more than $500 million to implement the Moving Forward regional economic statement, and significant investments in infrastructure projects through the Regional Infrastructure Development Fund; \u2022 enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the economy and workforce by encouraging greater workforce participation and focusing on improving the skills of Victorians through an additional investment of $316 million for Securing Jobs for Your Future: Skills for Victoria , which will provide an additional 172 000 training places; and \u2022 responding quickly and effectively to the 2009 global economic downturn with significant infrastructure investment, delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, providing both the infrastructure necessary for the recovery and creating jobs. Victoria has had strong employment growth, with an average annual employment growth of 2.1 per cent over the period from 1999-2000 to 2008-09. In 2008-09 the average annual employment rate was 61.3 per cent, higher than the 58.5 per cent in 1999-2000. Since 2000-01, total private business investment has grown by $23.3 billion. Over the last nine years, investment in machinery and equipment has grown by $9.3 billion. Growing and linking all of Victoria Over recent years the Government has invested in growing and linking all of Victoria by: \u2022 meeting growing demand and shaping a more efficient and sustainable state, through strategic planning initiatives, including the development of Melbourne 2030 and Melbourne @ 5 million , and through the development of the Victorian Transport Plan that provides more than $38 billion in projects; \u2022 reducing road transport travel times by extensively upgrading the metropolitan and regional road network, including the Springvale Road grade separation, the opening of EastLink, Geelong Ring Road, Calder Highway, Deer Park Bypass, significant progress on the Monash-CityLink-West Gate upgrade, and the commencement of the Peninsula Link project and Western Ring Road upgrade; \u2022 improving public transport services across Melbourne including through increasing the frequency and accessibility of bus services; completing major rail projects such as upgrades to North Melbourne and Footscray train stations, 200 kilometre of standardised trackon the North East rail line, and a new rail track and bridge at Clifton Hill; commencing work on the extensions to Sunbury and South Morang; and commencing early works at Southern Cross Station for the Regional Rail Link; \u2022 reducing travel times between Melbourne and regional Victoria by improving public transport services for regional Victoria including 100 new VLocity carriages representing 7 200 additional seats; fast rail services to Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley; and rail services to Ararat and Bairnsdale; and \u2022 improving access to public transport through tram platform stop designs and low-floor buses on metropolitan and regional services through the Bus Replacement Program. Between September 1999 and September 2009, Victoria's population grew by 16.4 per cent, reaching more than 5.4 million people. Regional rail passenger trips rose 9.5 per cent in the year to 2008-09, reaching 231 000 passenger trips per week. Metropolitan public transport patronage rose 9 per cent in the year to 2008-09, reaching 9.45 million passenger trips per week, representing the highest level of public transport passenger trips for over four decades. Challenges and responses While there remains uncertainty in the global economic outlook, Victoria's economy has proven resilient and growth is likely to strengthen and broaden in 2010-11. The Government recognises that the global economic environment has changed significantly in recent years and will continue to influence the success and prosperity of Victorian communities and industries. To ensure future prosperity, the Government will build on its record of strong fiscal management by further reducing the State's already low payroll taxes and WorkCover premiums, and reducing red tape. Lower business costs, the continued infrastructure investment delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, and other initiatives such as Jobs for the Future Economy , will secure more jobs across Victoria, boost economic potential, and sustain growth in a thriving economy. The Government is continuing to invest in transport infrastructure in line with the Victorian Transport Plan commitments. Improvements to regional and metropolitan road networks along with better public transport remain priorities. This investment will develop the most efficient and effective transport links to connect people to jobs and goods to market, which will support industrial growth, new jobs and assist the economy to grow. For example, the Government will deliver, in partnership with the Commonwealth, the new Regional Rail Link - a dedicated rail link from West Werribee to central Melbourne via Sunshine that will allow regional services to run express into Melbourne, improving travel times and options for people living in Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. Achieving outcomes through the delivery of outputs In 2010-11, the Government will contribute to the achievement of a thriving economy through output groups including: \u2022 Regional Development ; and Planning Communities for Growth and Change that provide support for infrastructure development in regional cities and towns so that jobs are created and industries are developed and sustained; \u2022 Public Transport Services ; and Integrated Transport Planning, Delivery and Management that provide improved transport infrastructure, and integrated planning, delivery and management of the metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria public transport system to increase its capacity thereby improving the movement of people, goods and services throughout Victoria; and reducing road congestion, transport emissions, and the reliance on private motor vehicles; and \u2022 Industries and Innovation, Strategic and Applied Scientific Research and Sustainable Practice Change that provide support for research, innovation and commercialisation to help industries access information and build capacity to develop and use new practices and technologies effectively, so that industry productivity and competitiveness is improved.

QUALITY HEALTH AND EDUCATION The significance of quality health and education The physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of Victorians is vital to a vibrant and prosperous Victoria. Individuals, children and their families need access to high quality health and community services that support their participation in the workforce and community life, to ensure the future growth and prosperity of Victoria. Education provides the foundation for participation in the workforce and in community life, and therefore is essential to a prosperous Victoria. Access to high quality education services from birth through to adulthood ensures that all individuals, children and young people are given the best chance to succeed in life. Health reform The Putting Patients First statement (Budget Information Paper No. 2) reflects the Agreement on health and hospitals reform between the Commonwealth Government and all Australian states and territories - other than Western Australia - reached on 20 April 2010. The Agreement will provide additional funding to cut emergency department waiting times at Victorian hospitals, carry out more elective surgery procedures, support older Victorians who have long stays in hospital and expand sub-acute services. Victoria will continue to run the system, with major reforms to Commonwealth and State roles and responsibilities ensuring that Victorians continue to enjoy world class, universally accessible health care. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE High quality, accessible health and community services Over recent years the Government has invested in high quality, accessible health and community services by: \u2022 expanding hospital capacity to enable the provision of 733 000 more treatments this year than in 1999, including 426 000 extra admissions; \u2022 increasing the capacity of essential hospital services to treat additional patients each year in emergency departments, as well as capacity to treat more elective surgery patients sooner, ease pressure on emergency departments, and provide an extra 10 500 nurses and 3 150 doctors; and \u2022 increasing survival rates from cancer through initiatives under the Victorian Cancer Action Plan, including investing in innovative research and prevention and treatment strategies. Victorians continue to enjoy a long life expectancy that has been consistently above the Australian average. Victoria's public hospitals treated 150 758 elective surgery patients in 2009 compared to 133 369 elective surgery patients in 2008. Immunisation rates for children have continued to increase steadily. High quality education and training for lifelong learning Over recent years the Government has invested in high quality education and training for lifelong learning by: \u2022 improving educational outcomes for school students by implementing the Blueprint for Government Schools (2003), and the Blueprint for Education and Early Childhood Development (2008); \u2022 investing in improved school curriculum, and providing an additional 10 000 full time equivalent teachers and support staff for schools to provide essential skills for ongoing progress in education, and to improve the transition of young people to further education and employment; \u2022 modernising and rebuilding Victorian schools, in particular building new schools in growth areas; and \u2022 training and skills development for lifelong learning through continued investment in Victoria's Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system, boosting apprenticeship capacity, creating more opportunities for Victorians for vocational learning pathways. The percentage of Year 3 and 5 Victorian students achieving reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks continues to be above the national average. The percentage of Victorians aged 20 to 24 who have completed Year 12 or its national equivalent (86.8 per cent) continues to be above the national average (84.5 per cent). Vocational Education and Training (VET) student contact hours among 25 to 64 year olds increased from approximately 40 million in 1999 to 58 million in 2008. Challenges and responses While Victorians enjoy health outcomes that are among the best in the world and have access to high quality health care, the challenges of an ageing and growing population, the rise of chronic disease, and the projected shortfall in the health workforce, require continuous improvement in the State's health system. The Government will continue to enhance the quality of Victoria's health system through infrastructure investments such as the new Bendigo Hospital, the Box Hill Hospital redevelopment, and in partnership with the Commonwealth Government, the $1 billion Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre. The Government will continue to invest in the delivery of services to meet the demands of a growing population, to reduce the incidence of ill-health, and to enhance the health sector's workforce and technology. To prepare for future economic and social prosperity in the increasingly complex, global and networked world in which we live, Victorians need to be highly skilled, productive and working. To meet this aim, a strong and effective education system is required that caters to the needs of individuals from birth to adulthood. This includes those groups of children and young people who face unique challenges or require a different set of educational approaches. The Government will continue to invest in early childhood services, schools, and the higher and vocational education sectors. Through the $1.9 billion Victorian Schools Plan and, in partnership with the Commonwealth, the $2.6 billion Building the Education Revolution , the Government is delivering the biggest upgrading of school infrastructure ever undertaken in Victoria, ensuring students receive the benefits of high quality school classrooms, facilities and equipment. Achieving outcomes through the delivery of outputs In 2010-11, the Government will contribute to the achievement of Quality Health and Education, through output groups including: \u2022 Acute Health Services ; Ambulance Services ; Mental Health ; and Aged and Home Care that maintain and improve access to a range of hospital, ambulatory, community based, residential and specialist services, including for older people and people with a mental illness and their families and carers, so that service waiting times and demand for hospital beds is reduced; the health of Victorians is improved; and their independence and participation in the community is enhanced or maintained; \u2022 Early Childhood Services ; Later Years and Youth Transitions ; and Services to Students that provide education and integrated support services for children and young people, to develop foundation skills and broader competencies for ongoing education, and provide pathways and support for young people to make a successful transition to further study, employment or a combination of both; and \u2022 Skills and Workforce that provides planning and purchasing of vocational education and training (VET) services; and build the capability and competitiveness of the VET system to improve its quality and effectiveness so that participation increases, leading to a more skilled Victorian workforce. The following table summarises, by department, the output groups under which the Government will deliver outputs in 2010-11 in working towards the achievement of quality health and education. Education and Early Childhood Development Early Childhood Services; Compulsory Years; Later Years and Youth Transitions; Services to Students; Adolescent Health Services (schools); Policy and Regulation. Health Acute Health Services; Ambulance Services; Mental Health; Aged and Home Care; Primary and Dental Health; Small Rural Services; Public Health; Drug Services.

Innovation, Industry and Regional Development Industries and Innovation; Skills and Workforce. Premier and Cabinet Strategic Policy Advice and Support; Arts and Cultural Development. Detailed information for individual outputs under these groups can be found in Chapter 3 Departmental Output Statements . HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT The significance of a healthy environment Victoria has a rich and diverse natural environment, which supports our lives, communities, industries, and jobs; and provides a home for precious native plants and animals. Protecting and sustaining the environment for future generations in the face of challenges such as climate change is an important task with significant economic and social implications. The future under the effects of climate change will be warmer and drier, with the increasing likelihood of more extreme events such as heatwaves, bushfires and storms. The Government has already taken strong action on climate change, including setting a renewable energy target, making a major investment in low emissions technologies, and acting to secure Victoria's future water supply. The Government will continue to build on this investment by developing a comprehensive response to climate change, in order to preserve Victoria's strong and dynamic economy, great quality of life, and unique natural environment for future generations. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE Protecting the environment for future generations Over recent years the Government has invested in protecting the environment for future generations by: \u2022 expanding the conservation reserve system by creating the Cobbobonee National Park and Forest Park, and protecting 160 000 hectares of the River Red Gum Forest, including the establishment of four new national parks along Victoria's Murray River corridor; \u2022 continuing sustainable forest management and protection of Victoria's key biodiversity areas through adding over 45 000 hectares of State forest to the conservation reserve system in East Gippsland, including significant stands of old-growth forest and rainforest sites; \u2022 taking action to secure the health of Victoria's land, water and biodiversity in the face of ongoing pressures, drought, and a changing climate over the next 50 years through Securing our Natural Future: A white paper for land and biodiversity at a time of climate change launched in December 2009; \u2022 reducing the risk to Victorian communities from bushfire and enhancing biodiversity through planned burning on public land; and \u2022 minimising and managing adverse effects of proposed projects (works) that could have a significant effect on the environment through the Environmental Effects Statement process. The quality of Victoria's drinking water continues to improve, with compliance of the E. coli water quality standard increasing from 95 per cent in 2004-05 to 99 per cent in 2008-09 across the State's water sampling localities. Efficient use of natural resources Over recent years the Government has invested in achieving the efficient use of natural resources by: \u2022 leading the development of a marine policy to guide the allocation of coastal Crown land for the purpose of developing marine energy facilities; \u2022 reducing water wastage through upgrading irrigation infrastructure, such as the completion of the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline and progression of the Hamilton-Grampians pipeline; and \u2022 reducing Victoria's greenhouse gas emissions through strategies, such as the Victorian Renewable Energy Target, which in 2010 will transition into the Commonwealth's expanded program that seeks to increase the share of renewable energy in Australia to 20 per cent by 2020; and the Energy Technology Innovation Strategy which aims to drive advances in low emission and renewable technologies and to secure Victoria's energy future. During the period from 1999 to 2008, the emissions intensity of the Victorian economy has declined by 24 per cent. That is, for each dollar of Victorian gross state product (GSP) created, less greenhouse gases were emitted. Compared with 1999-2000, the Victorian economy is producing less waste per unit of real GSP. The amount of material recovered from the solid waste stream in Victoria for reuse, recycling and energy generation has steadily increased from 43 per cent in 1999-2000 to 61 per cent in 2007-08. Challenges and responses Adapting to the impacts of climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable and low emission energy sources, sustainable water use, and reducing waste require new ways of thinking and working to deliver economic and environmental benefits for all Victorians. Global economic conditions and a growing population add to these challenges and make it even more important to strike the right balance between the competing needs of the community, the economy and the environment. Responding to these challenges together with the emerging low carbon economy, the Government has released a Climate Change Green Paper, and the upcoming White Paper will outline a comprehensive climate change strategy for Victoria out to 2020. For example, a new Climate Communities program will help individuals and communities to take action to reduce emissions through local projects that meet objectives in the areas of climate abatement, climate resilience and climate innovation. The new framework for land and biodiversity will build ecosystem resilience, target investment and resources to priority areas and improve ecological connectivity through a network of biolinks that protect key habitat and ecosystems. The new Landhealth program will develop the research, planning and tools necessary to support landscape resilience in critical parts of the State. Achieving outcomes through the delivery of outputs In 2010-11, the Government will contribute to the achievement of a Healthy Environment, through output groups including: \u2022 Healthy and Productive Water Systems that delivers policies, regulatory systems and institutional arrangements that drive sustainable management and efficient use of Victoria's water resources so that Victoria's water supply is safe and reliable, its rivers are healthy, and irrigation is sustainable; \u2022 Healthy and Productive Land that manages Victoria's public land assets, programs and services; seeks adaptation to climate change; conducts ecological research to inform land users on maintaining ecological assets; and provides clear policies, legislation and advice so that the condition of Victoria's natural assets is improved and the natural environment is protected for future generations. The output group also includes fuel management activities and ensures an effectively trained and prepared workforce for fire suppression events to protect biodiversity and communities across Victoria; and \u2022 Less Waste, Less Pollution; and Clean Air, Liveable Climate that provides a strategic response to issues of environmental sustainability and climate change, including through promoting greater community involvement and ownership of environmental issues; and improving recycling and management of residual waste to reduce local pollution problems and prevent contamination of land and groundwater. The following table summarises, by department, the output groups under which the Government will deliver outputs in 2010-11 in working towards the achievement of a healthy environment. Premier and Cabinet Strategic Policy Advice and Support. Primary Industries Primary Industries Policy; Regulation and Compliance; Strategic and Applied Scientific Research; Sustainable Practice Change. Sustainability and Environment Healthy and Productive Water Systems; Healthy and Productive Land; Healthy, Productive and Accessible Marine, Coastal and Estuarine Systems; and Flourishing Biodiversity in Healthy Ecosystems; Less Waste, Less Pollution; and Clean Air, Liveable Climate; Land Administration and Property Information. Transport Integrated Transport Planning, Delivery and Management. Detailed information for individual outputs under these groups can be found in Chapter 3 Departmental Output Statements . CARING COMMUNITIES The significance of caring communities Communities that are safe places to live, work and raise a family are built on support networks, and appropriate services and infrastructure. Safety comes from good communication, responsive policing and emergency services, effective measures to address the causes of crime, appropriate housing, community participation and support for the disadvantaged. The Government will continue to provide safe streets and homes for Victorians, and invest in community strengthening strategies through initiatives such as A Fairer Victoria which sets out a framework to reduce disadvantage and increase opportunities for all Victorians. Initiatives under A Fairer Victoria will assist Victorian children to get the best start, help people into work by reducing educational inequalities and address barriers to workforce participation, which will improve health, wellbeing and develop liveable communities. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE Building friendly, confident and safe communities The Government has invested in building friendly, confident and safe communities by: \u2022 improving the safety of Victorians through a stronger and more accessible police presence with funding for an additional 1 920 police (by November 2010), initiatives to fight organised crime and terrorism, and investment to rebuild and refurbish more than 160 police stations across the State; \u2022 protecting the rights of the community through delivering a Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities and establishing specialist courts to tackle disadvantage in indigenous communities, family violence and drugs; and \u2022 significantly improving services and support for victims of crime including; implementing The Victims Charter, increasing compensation to victims, providing specialist family violence services and making major changes to sexual assault laws and procedures. Since 2000-01, Victoria's crime rate has reduced by 25.5 per cent. In 2008, the Perceptions of Justice Survey continued to show that Victorians' feelings of personal safety remained at high levels, with most people surveyed feeling 'safe' or 'very safe' throughout 2009. A fairer society that reduces disadvantage and respects diversity Over recent years the Government has invested in a fairer society that reduces disadvantage and respects diversity by: \u2022 addressing disadvantage in the community through investing $5 billion to date in initiatives outlined in A Fairer Victoria , delivering universal services and targeting resources for disadvantaged places and people; \u2022 keeping young people engaged through Local Learning and Employment Networks, assisting thousands of young people to re-engage in education and training; \u2022 continuing to close the gap across a range of economic, social and life expectancy indicators for indigenous Victorians, particularly for young people. Initiatives for indigenous Victorians include an education strategy for students (Wannik), new courts, free kindergarten for three year old children, new maternity services and new in home support for new parents; and \u2022 ensuring that vulnerable children and their families receive more robust, integrated and comprehensive assistance through reforms to the child protection service system. This includes the introduction of new legislation and Government investment in a range of enhancements such as ChildFIRST, an innovative approach involving a partnership with community service providers, and sustaining out of home care placements. In 2009, the self rated health status of Victorians continues to improve. The number of people assisted with homelessness support increased by nearly 16 000 people from 1999 to 2008-09. Challenges and responses Challenges such as alcohol-related and community violence, managing the sustainable growth of the State's cities and regions, and adapting to the impacts of extreme weather events need to be continually addressed to make Victoria a safer place to live, work and raise a family. To address these challenges, the Government will invest in additional police and the justice system, raise awareness of human rights and the need for respect in communities, provide community assistance for bushfire recovery, and improve regional transport, infrastructure and services to maximise opportunities for people to participate in Victorian life. Achieving outcomes through the delivery of outputs In 2010-11, the Government will contribute to the achievement of Caring Communities, through output groups including: \u2022 Providing a Safe and Secure Society ; Dispensing Justice ; and Enforcing Correctional Orders that provide law enforcement that prevents, detects and investigates crime and provides community assistance, guidance and leadership; and judicial services including management of the State's system of correctional facilities to increase the capacity of law enforcement agencies, and to reduce crime and the propensity to offend so that people can undertake their lawful pursuits confidently and safely; \u2022 Strengthening Communities and Promoting Inclusion that provides leadership and whole of government policy on indigenous, youth, women, disability, veterans and older Victorians to build participation, including in vocational adult community education, and sport and recreation, so that communities are more engaged and resilient; \u2022 Investing in Community Capacity and Infrastructure that provides services to build community capacity to engage in decision-making processes; strengthen community sector organisations; support volunteering; and assist local governments to develop sustainable service delivery and asset management; \u2022 Multicultural Affairs that provide leadership and whole of government policy on multicultural affairs to encourage the full participation of Victoria's culturally, linguistically and religiously diverse communities in all aspects of life in Victoria; \u2022 Disability Services that provides continuing care and support services for people with disabilities, their carers and families to maximise their independence and participation in society; and \u2022 Housing Assistance that provides a range of homelessness services, crisis and transitional accommodation and long-term housing assistance for those in housing stress to prevent homelessness, reduce demand for social housing, and maintain or enhance independence and participation in the community. The following table summarises, by department, the output groups under which the Government will deliver outputs in 2010-11 in working towards the achievement of caring communities. Education and Early Childhood Development Early Childhood Services; Compulsory Years; Later Years and Youth Transitions; Services to Students; Policy and Regulation. Health Acute Health Services; Mental Health; Aged and Home Care; Primary and Dental Health; Small Rural Services; Public Health; Drug Services.

Transport Transport Safety and Security. Detailed information for individual outputs under these groups can be found in Chapter 3 Departmental Output Statements . VIBRANT DEMOCRACY The significance of a vibrant democracy Victoria's ability to attract people, investment and new jobs, to provide better services, and to protect the environment and our metropolitan and regional liveability, depends on a strong and secure financial base and a fair opportunity for the community to participate in social and economic life. It also depends on the Government's commitment to being open and accountable to the people of Victoria, to a strong judicial system, and for the community to be informed about and engaged in government decision making and community life. In line with A Fairer Victoria , the Government has implemented new ways of working with communities that have enabled them to have a greater say in determining their futures, through consultation processes and discussion papers, as demonstrated though the development of the Climate Change Green Paper. The Government's strong and prudent financial management over the past decade helped position Victoria to maximise its recovery from the global downturn. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE Greater public participation and more accountable government Over recent years the Government has invested in achieving greater public participation and more accountable government by: \u2022 giving Victorians the opportunity to speak directly with decision makers, with 91 Community Cabinets held in towns and suburbs from Mildura to Gippsland; and to participate in and be consulted with on a range of key policy areas, such as climate change, transport, drought and mental health; and \u2022 improving the openness of the Government through the Parliament's annual Statement of Government Intentions, the Premier's website, and broadcasts of parliamentary question time, which ensures that the agenda of Government is transparent. The Victorian Population Health Survey showed that in 2009, the proportion of Victorians who feel they have a say on issues that matter to them has increased from 2001. Sound financial management Over recent years the Government has invested in sound financial management by: \u2022 maintaining a healthy operating surplus through strong economic and fiscal management, which positioned Victoria well to weather the effects of the global financial crisis by enabling a record job-creating infrastructure investment to secure jobs and growth; and \u2022 achieving and maintaining a AAA credit rating and improving the State's tax competitiveness, which continues to affirm the Government's long record of responsible financial management. Victoria's AAA credit rating was reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's in September 2009 and Moody's Investors Service in January 2009. Challenges and responses The Victorian Government must manage its finances in the face of significant external influences, including increasing health care demand and uncertain global economic conditions, to be able to fund the investments and services necessary to achieve growth and prosperity for all Victorians. The Government will respond to this challenge through prudent financial management and a continuing commitment to taxation and regulatory reform, which aim to provide a stable and supportive environment for individuals, communities and businesses to benefit from a strong, fair and prosperous Victoria. Significant population growth requires continued investment in the development and maintenance of cohesive and tolerant communities that participate in civic activities. The Government will continue to encourage and support community participation in civic activity, including through education and the use of new technologies to provide community access to government consultative and decision-making forums. It will continue to seek ways to improve government accountability, including that of local governments through initiatives such as the formation of the Local Government Inspectorate. Achieving outcomes through the delivery of outputs In 2010-11, the Government will contribute to the achievement of a Vibrant Democracy, through output groups including: \u2022 Public Sector Management, Governance and Support ; and Strategic Policy Advice and Support that provide services for the effective management, governance and support of the public sector; advice and support to the Governor including maintenance of Government House and its collections; and research so that government and public sector accountability and performance is enhanced and the Victorian community is more informed and engaged; and \u2022 Strategic Policy Advice ; Financial, Risk, Resource, and Revenue Management Services ; and Regulatory Services that inform Ministers on the State's financial and budget strategy; taxation, accounting and reporting policies; insurance schemes; economic, social and environmental monitoring; and inter-government financial analysis so that government financial management and assurance frameworks are cohesive; government can make sound and informed financial and economic decisions; and Victorian consumers are protected with regard to essential services price, quality and reliability. The following table summarises, by department, the output groups under which the Government will deliver outputs in 2010-11 in working towards the achievement of a vibrant democracy. Education and Early Childhood Development Policy and Regulation. Justice Legal Support to Government and Protecting the Rights of Victorians; Regulating Gaming and Racing.

The output information included in this chapter provides clear and transparent accountability for departmental service delivery. An output represents the aggregate of goods or services which are either produced or delivered by, or on behalf of, a department and its agencies. The quantity, quality, timeliness and cost performance measures listed for each output are used to assess each department's performance in service delivery. The output statements reflect the Government's investment in services during the year in terms of the cost of each output, the quantity of the output units to be delivered, the level of the quality and the timeliness of the output delivery. Preceding each department's output statement is a summary of the main challenges or issues facing the departments in the medium-term and a discussion of the department's significant policy decisions and directions. This information intends to explain, at an aggregate level, how departmental service delivery in the forthcoming year will contribute to the achievement of Growing Victoria Together. Consistent with the Government's ongoing commitment to improve accountability and performance, departmental outputs and the performance measures used to evaluate service delivery are assessed annually for their continuing relevance and robustness. Where departments have introduced changes to their outputs, these changes are reflected in a summary table with an explanation as to the nature of the change. For some outputs, performance measures that were reported in 2009-10 may not be reported in 2010-11. Outputs and their performance measures which are no longer being reported in 2010-11 are identified in Appendix C Discontinued outputs and/or measures. Common reasons for the discontinuation of performance measures include the achievement of milestones in a period, the impact of policy decisions and the implementation of different programs. In 2010-11, some departments have also introduced changes to the outputs and associated performance measures that they will deliver. These changes mainly reflect the impact of machinery of government changes since the 2009-10 Budget as well as the implementation of changes to department's organisation/business structures to better facilitate improvements in the delivery of goods and services on behalf of government. Information about these changes is provided within each department's output statement. Within the output statements, 'nm' refers to a new performance measure and 'na' refers to data either not being available or not applicable in the specified year. Where a department has included a new measure in 2010-11, historical performance data has been provided, where available, to assist with comparability of performance over time. Total expenditure for departments can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT Departmental mission statement Ensure a high-quality and coherent birth-to-adulthood learning and development system to build the capability of every young Victorian. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term Victoria and governments across the world recognise the need to prepare and support children for modern life from birth through to adulthood. The Department is improving the learning, development, health and wellbeing of Victorian children and young people through integrating early childhood and school education services. The integration of services recognises the importance of early childhood as a foundation for optimal life outcomes and acknowledges that twenty-first century learning demands a holistic approach to excellence at all age levels and all parts of the system. Changes in demographics and recognition of the effects of disadvantage are challenges for both the education and early childhood sectors. Other trends include: \u2022 continuing technological change and a growing need for technology literacy among both students and education providers; \u2022 an increasing global demand for an education that ensures workforce readiness; \u2022 a growing emphasis on integrated service provision, with strong connections between community agencies, early childhood services and schools, and a focus on accommodating diverse and specialised needs of children and families; \u2022 the concept of 'pathways' will elongate to encompass lifelong learning - from pre-school through university and employment to retirement; and \u2022 planning to meet emerging economic circumstances, including changes to the level of demand for services, and where those services are needed (for example, higher Year 12 retention in tougher economic times). Early childhood sector The regulation, funding and provision of early childhood services involve Commonwealth, state and local government, community groups and the private sector. Increasingly, parents expect high-quality early childhood services, and kindergarten programs to be offered in child care settings. The availability and use of formal childcare has grown significantly over the past two decades but access is still restricted by hours of operation, limited places, cost, and sessional programs that presume parents are available during the day. The challenges confronting the Department in the early childhood sector include: \u2022 improving the quality of early childhood services; \u2022 coordinating services so that all children are accessing the programs and supports that will ensure a healthy and safe start to life while supporting the workforce participation or education needs of parents; \u2022 linking early childhood services to clear developmental outcomes for children; and \u2022 improving parents' understanding of service quality and ability to access services, and the need to ensure that parents whose children need additional and specialist support can access it when they need to. School sector The challenges confronting the Department in the school education sector include: \u2022 responding to the challenge that some students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are over-represented among low achievers and underrepresented among high achievers; \u2022 a continuing need to provide versatility in pathways to accommodate higher community expectations that schools play their part in engaging and retaining young people in education and training; \u2022 the need for highly integrated service provision, with strong connections between community agencies, early childhood services and schools, and a focus on accommodating diverse and specialised needs of children and families; \u2022 managing demand for resources to support the growth in the number of students with disabilities; \u2022 planning for an ageing teacher workforce and ensuring supply of high-quality entrants into the teaching profession; and \u2022 planning to respond to emergencies, for example the Victorian bushfires and the H1N1 (swine flu) virus. Major policy decisions and directions Growing Victoria Together highlights the importance of high quality education and training for lifelong learning and high quality accessible health and community services and includes the following key measures of achievement: \u2022 the wellbeing of young children will improve; \u2022 the proportion of Victorian primary students achieving the national benchmark levels for reading, writing and numeracy will be at or above the national average; \u2022 by 2010, 90 per cent of young people in Victoria will successfully complete Year 12 or its equivalent; and \u2022 the number of early school leavers who are unemployed after six months will decline. The Blueprint for Education and Early Childhood Development (2008) sets out the Government's five-year agenda for learning and development from birth to adulthood. It provides an integrated policy framework for early childhood and education services and focuses on system improvements, partnerships with parents and communities, and workforce reform. The Department's Corporate Plan (2009-11) has a focus on developing and implementing a reform agenda designed to improve performance and promote excellence across Victoria's schools and early childhood services, and to drive continuous corporate improvement. The reform agenda is articulated within the Blueprint. The National Education Agreement (2008) and the Victorian-led National Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (2008) are providing opportunities to create a shared national vision and a collaborative approach to improving outcomes for Australian children. Ministerial portfolios The Department supports the ministerial portfolios of Education, and Children and Early Childhood Development. Changes to the output structure The Department has not made any changes to its output structure in 2010-11. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost.

(e) The higher Expected Outcome in 2009-10 was a result of over-achievement by municipal Councils. (f) The high 2008-09 Actual was due to the full year effect of interface Councils, which support Melbourne's growth areas, receiving enhanced maternal and child health services funding. (g) Refers to the financial year. Notes (continued): (h) The 2010-11 Target is greater than the 2009-10 Target as a result of initiatives funded from the 2010-11 Budget and price escalation for anticipated cost increases in 2010-11. Refer to Appendix A for further details. (i) The number of children funded to participate in kindergarten includes second year participants. The 2010-11 Target has increased to reflect the 2010-11 Budget initiative, which provided additional kindergarten places as a result of continued growth in demand. Refer to Appendix A for further details. (j) The 2009-10 and 2010-11 Targets, 2009-10 Expected Outcome and 2008-09 Actual for the 'Kindergarten Participation Rate' measure are calculated using revised population figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics following the latest census. Consequently, they are not directly comparable with the Targets or Actuals of previous years. The 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the actual 2009-10 result. This measure covers first year participants only. (k) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is greater than the 2009-10 Target as a result of initiatives funded from the 2010-11 Budget with funding implications in the 2009-10 financial year, including Kindergarten Enrolment based funding, and the effect of funding carried over into the 2009-10 financial year not budgeted in the 2009-10 Target. The 2010-11 Target is greater than the 2009-10 Target as a result of initiatives funded from the 2010-11 Budget , including Continue and Extend the Victorian Children's Capital Program and Kindergarten Enrolment Base Funding, and price escalation for anticipated cost increases in 2010-11. (l) Information for 2009-10 and onwards refer to the previous financial year to align with Enhanced Maternal and Child Health Services performance measures that use the same data system. (m) Information for 2009-10 and onwards refers to the previous financial year to align with the performance measure 'Total number of children receiving a service'. (n) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is less than the 2009-10 Target resulting from the combined effect of expenditure carried over into 2009-10 being less than budgeted and anticipated expenditure to be carried over into the 2010-11 financial year. The 2010-11 Target is greater than the 2009-10 Expected Outcome as a result of expenditure being carried over into the 2010-11 financial year and initiatives funded from within the 2010-11 Budget . The 2010-11 Target is less than the 2009-10 Target due to the 2009-10 Target containing a one-off expected carry forward."

The 'early years' of schooling output is concerned with developing the essential skills necessary for ongoing progress in education and providing learning experiences to engage young minds. Literacy and numeracy are foremost among the skills learnt during these foundation years. The 'middle years' of schooling output refers to a fundamental stage of learning where students growing from childhood to adolescence consolidate competencies in literacy and numeracy, and continue their physical, social, emotional and intellectual development of early adolescence. It is also a stage when they attain a greater breadth of knowledge and learning, including extending their capacity for creative and critical thinking. These outputs include development and management of education programs and curriculum.

Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term The Department works with the community to provide better access to health, aged care and mental health and drug services. This is delivered through managing the public hospital system, developing health infrastructure in rural and metropolitan Victoria, pursuing opportunities for partnership with the primary care sector and other governments, public health interventions, and implementing major health initiatives. The Department also encourages Victorians to improve their health through preventative health initiatives and education programs. Challenges identified by the Department to ensure access, quality and sustainability of Victoria's health services in the medium term include: Managing demand for services \u2022 aligning service capacity with service demand; \u2022 responding to increasing complexity of client need; and \u2022 ensuring access to appropriate service types. Addressing disadvantage \u2022 improving access to universal services; \u2022 strengthening assistance to disadvantaged groups; and \u2022 breaking down concentrations of disadvantage. Addressing emerging health issues \u2022 improving the care and early detection of chronic disease; and \u2022 preventing obesity. Improving sustainability and productivity \u2022 improving service productivity; \u2022 developing a skilled and flexible workforce; and \u2022 using progress in technology and knowledge. Acting sooner and more effectively \u2022 shifting the focus towards effective prevention and early intervention; \u2022 giving children the best start in life; and \u2022 delivering services around person and place. Major policy decisions and directions The major policy decisions and directions for the Department for 2010-11 are: \u2022 improve health service performance - provide access to the best care possible for all Victorians; \u2022 reform our response to mental health and drug and alcohol services to meet client needs - develop better systems to provide help earlier, deliver effective treatment and support recovery outcomes for those with, or at risk of, mental health and drug use problems; \u2022 strengthen prevention and health promotion - reduce the incidence of preventable disease through education programs and regulation; \u2022 develop our health service system and organisation - provide high quality relationship management, policy development and performance management to ensure a sustainable Victorian health system; \u2022 respond to an ageing population - design and adapt services to meet the health and wellbeing needs of an increasing number of older Victorians, maximise independence and promote healthy ageing; and \u2022 reduce health inequalities - tackle the differences in health access and outcomes, especially for disadvantaged groups in our community. Changes to the output structure On 12 August 2009, the Premier announced the creation of a new Department of Health (incorporating health, mental health and drugs and aged care) and a new Department of Human Services (comprising disability, housing, children, youth and families). The Department's output structure has been altered to align with the strategic directions and priorities of the Government. The new Department's output structure in 2010-11 is shown in the table below . 2010-11 Outputs Reason 2009-10 Outputs Admitted Services Machinery of government changes Refer to Department of Human Services output statements Non Admitted Services Emergency Services Acute Training and Development Ambulance Emergency Services Ambulance Non Emergency Services Clinical Care Psychiatric Disability Rehabilitation and Support Services (PDRSS) Residential Aged Care Aged Care Assessment Aged Support Services HACC Primary Health, Community Care and Support Community Health Care Dental Services Small Rural Services - Acute Health Small Rural Services - Aged Care Small Rural Services - Home and Community Care Services Small Rural Services - Primary Health Health Protection Health Advancement Public Health Development, Research and Support Drug Prevention and Control Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation The new Department's output structure has resulted in twenty-three outputs transferred out of the Department of Human Services. Discontinued outputs and performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the Department's 2010-11 output structure and therefore allocations may differ from the Department's previously published budget.

(b) Increases in the Department of Health's 2010-11 Budget compared with the 2009-10 Budget are primarily due to: - funding provided for government policy commitments including the full-year effect of initiative funding announced in previous years budgets; - output price increases arising from Australian Industrial Relations Commission decisions and enterprise bargaining agreements; - indexation funding provided for anticipated cost increases in 2010-11; - increased Commonwealth funding due to the expansion of a number of programs; - increases in income from sales of goods and services, particularly for Public Hospitals and Ambulance Services; and - additional depreciation resulting from the revaluation of health services' assets. (c) The 2010-11 Budget includes additional funding resulting from the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement recently negotiated by Council of Australian Governments (COAG). (d) The 2010-11 Budget includes: - increased third party revenue for membership and transport user charges; and - additional funding for indexation and the Ambulance Service Strategy initiative. (e) The 2010-11 Budget reflects additional funding for policy initiatives including the 'Mental Health Strategy'. (f) The 2010-11 Budget reflects additional Commonwealth and state-matched funding for Home and Community Care Services and transfers to Small Rural Services. (g) The 2010-11 Budget reflects the transfer of funding for Bushfire Case Management and Bushfire Recovery Services to Department of Human Services. (h) The 2010-11 Budget also includes an increase in patient fees collected by agencies. (i) The 2010-11 Budget also includes funding for Whooping cough vaccination for parents of new babies and an increase in Commonwealth funding for Essential Vaccines. (j) The 2010-11 Budget also reflects additional funding for the 'Alcohol and other drug treatment sector reform' initiatives. (k) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements ."

DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES Departmental mission statement The Department of Human Services (DHS) improves people's lives and reduces their experience of disadvantage. To achieve this, the Department provides housing and community services to support and protect Victorians most in need. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term The Department continues to respond to demand for human services to ensure its clients receive the timely and responsive support they require. The Department will build on recent initiatives related to child protection services, which have focused on attracting and retaining the workforce necessary to provide each child protection case with a child protection worker. Out of home care services are being positioned to provide safer residential care to meet the increasingly diverse, and often complex, needs of children and young people. Disability services capacity is expanding to help meet growing demand, driven by the ageing of carers and the ageing population. The social housing system is responding to the many low income Victorians unable to access affordable housing. Longer term challenges include: Making a positive impact on disadvantage Some individuals, families and communities suffer from a combination of linked problems, such as poor skills, unemployment, bad health and family breakdown. These issues can act to prevent their full participation in the community and reinforce a reliance on social support services. Addressing increasing complexity The increasing incidence of combined social and other issues means that some clients are likely to require more integrated and responsive support. Building workforce for the future The human services workforce is ageing which has the potential to reduce the Department's capacity to respond to future needs. Meeting the growing expectations of Victorians Clients and the community have higher expectations of the Department and services, particularly in relation to convenience and quality. Preparing for an ageing and growing population The impacts of ageing will be most pronounced in rural Victoria while rapid residential development is expected to continue in metropolitan growth corridors, creating new challenges for service provision. Responding effectively to extreme weather events The Department expects to be increasingly involved in supporting communities as they prepare and recover from natural and other emergencies. Major policy directions The Department has two overarching objectives to guide responses to these challenges and to address the goals set out in Growing Victoria Together , A Fairer Victoria , and the Government's Action for Victoria's Future framework. The Department's objectives are: \u2022 With it's partners, the Department aims to make a positive difference for Victorians experiencing disadvantage: \u2212 respond to the needs of individuals and communities at greater risk; \u2212 respond early to need; \u2212 provide opportunities for our clients to participate in society; and \u2212 strive for our clients to exercise greater choice. \u2022 With it's partners, the Department aims to provide excellent housing and community services that meet the needs of our clients: \u2212 improve services through better integration and innovation; \u2212 deliver sustainable client-centred services; \u2212 develop the capacity of the workforce; and \u2212 work closely with industry, government and other partners. Ministerial portfolios The Department supports the ministerial portfolios of Community Services and Housing. Changes to the output structure The Department has made changes to its output structure in 2010-11 as shown in the table below. 2010-11 Outputs Reason 2009-10 Outputs Refer to Department of Health output statements Machinery of government changes Admitted Services Non Admitted Services Emergency Services Acute Training and Development Ambulance Emergency Services Ambulance Non Emergency Services Clinical Care Psychiatric Disability Rehabilitation and Support Services (PDRSS) Residential Aged Care Aged Care Assessment Aged Support Services HACC Primary Health, Community Care and Support Community Health Care Dental Services Small Rural Services - Acute Health Small Rural Services - Aged Care Small Rural Services - Home and Community Care Services Small Rural Services- Primary Health Health Protection Health Advancement Public Health Development, Research and Support Drug Prevention and Control Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Social Housing Restructure Homelessness Assistance Housing Support and Homelessness Assistance Long Term Housing Assistance Home ownership and Renovation Assistance The Department's output structure has been altered to align with the strategic directions and priorities of the Government and the Department. The announcement of the new Department of Health on 12 August 2009 resulted in twenty three outputs transferred out of DHS. The merging of the three outputs, Homelessness Assistance, Long Term Housing Assistance and Home Ownership and Renovation Assistance will establish a new framework for integrated reporting of housing assistance that more clearly tracks performance across multiple tenures and programs providing capacity to reflect progress in implementing new programs arising from the implementation of COAG reforms. Discontinued outputs and performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the Department's 2010-11 output structure and therefore allocations may differ from the Department's previously published budget. Table 3.3: Output summary ($ million) 2009-10 Budget 2009-10 2010-11 Budget Variation (a)(b) % Revised Disability Services 1 287.9 1 305.2 1 370.4 6.4 Child Protection and Family Services (c) 583.0 600.6 653.1 12.0 Youth Services and Youth Justice 104.8 106.8 114.2 9.0 Concessions to Pensioners and Beneficiaries (d)(e) 463.4 503.4 493.2 6.4 Housing Assistance (f) 969.7 770.0 730.4 -24.7 Total (g) 3 408.8 3 286.0 3 361.3 -1.4 Source: Department of Human Services. Notes: (a) Variation between 2009-10 Budget and 2010-11 Budget . (b) Variations in the Department of Human Services' 2010-11 Budget compared with the 2009-10 Budget are primarily due to: - funding provided for government policy commitments including the full-year effect of initiative funding announced in previous years budgets; - indexation funding provided for anticipated cost increases in 2010-11; and - output price increases for depreciation and capital asset charge costs associated with the approved asset investment program for 2010-11. (c) The 2010-11 Budget reflects additional investment in new initiatives, including strengthening workforce development and retention, improving the accountability and monitoring of child protection practice, improving responses to sexual assault and child abuse, and the government's reform strategy for out of home care. (d) The output summary includes funding for transport concessions transferred to the Department of Transport. This funding is reflected in the Department of Transport's Public Transport Services outputs. (e) The 2010-11 Budget reflects the transfer of funding for Bushfire Case Management and Bushfire Recovery Services from Department of Health, and additional funding for growth, indexation and government initiatives including Helping Low income Victorians with the Rising Costs of Water and Emergency Management Response and Recovery Capacity. (f) The 2010-11 Budget primarily reflects a reduction in fixed term Commonwealth funding for the Social Housing and Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan initiatives. (g) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statement due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements ."

(c) The lower 2009-10 Expected Outcome and 2010-11 Target reflect the lower turnover rate in transitional housing management (THM) properties, decreasing the number of households assisted in these properties. This can be attributed to longer tenancies in THM as fewer clients can find affordable accommodation to exit to (eg private rental). (d) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Long Term Housing Assistance'. This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Number of households assisted (public, indigenous and community long-term tenancies at end of year)'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for inclusion of wording 'inclusion of long-term social housing' and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10'. (e) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects increased numbers of households assisted due to the higher number of acquisitions. (f) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued 'Long Term Housing Assistance' output. This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Number of dwellings with major upgrade during year (includes neighbourhood renewal areas)'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for the inclusion of text 'public housing' and the removal of text '(includes neighbourhood renewal areas)' and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (g) The lower 2010-11 Target reflects cessation of Commonwealth funding in 2009-10. (h) This new performance measure for 2010-11 reflects Government priorities regarding social housing projects funded under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The 2009-10 Expected Outcome and 2010-11 Target have been set based on anticipated Nation Building performance. (i) 2009-10 Expected Outcome has been included as data became available in 2009-10 in line with reporting mechanisms to the Commonwealth Government for the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. (j) This new performance measure for 2010-11 includes social housing properties used for transition and crisis accommodation program and replaces the discontinued 2009-10 performance measure 'Total long-term, social housing properties (includes leases, joint ventures and Office of Housing funded community owned dwellings)' in the discontinued output, 'Long Term Housing Assistance'. The 2009-10 measure did not include properties used for crisis or transitional accommodation. (k) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects additional funding from the Commonwealth 'Nation Building and Jobs Plan'. (l) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome has been included as data was available and reflects the consolidation of reporting of dwellings used for long term, crisis and transitional housing. (m) This new performance measure for 2010-11 includes social housing properties acquired for long term, transitional and crisis accommodation programs and replaces the discontinued 2009-10 measure 'Properties acquired during year for long-term housing (includes leases, and joint ventures and Office of Housing funded community owned dwellings)' under the discontinued output', Long Term Housing Assistance'. The 2009-10 measure did not include social housing properties acquired for transitional and crisis accommodation programs. Notes (continued): (n) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects additional funding from the Commonwealth 'Nation Building and Jobs Plan'. (o) This is a new performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect public housing maintenance completed by contractors within specified timeframes. (p) This measure is transferred from the discontinued output, 'Long Term Housing Assistance' and replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Average waiting time for public rental housing for those clients who have received early housing allocation (those with urgent housing need, under waiting list segments 1, 2 and 3)'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for removal of text ' (those with urgent housing need, under waiting list segments 1, 2 and 3)' and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (q) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to low vacancy rates in the private rental market and impact of the Victoria bush fires. The 2010-11 Target has been adjusted accordingly. (r) Output cost data is only available for the 2010-11 Target as this is a newly created output from the merging of three outputs, 'Homelessness Assistance', 'Long Term Housing Assistance' and 'Home Ownership and Renovation Assistance' reported in 2009-10, into 'Social Housing' and 'Housing Support and Homelessness Assistance'. (s) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output, 'Long Term Housing Assistance'. (t) This is a new measure of the number of clients assisted with case management by funded agencies through the Homelessness Support Program and the Social Housing and Advocacy Support Program (SHASP). This measure replaces the 2009-10 measure 'clients assisted with homelessness support' which only measured clients assisted through the Homelessness Support Program (formerly known as the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program), and excluded clients assisted through SHASP. (u) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Homelessness Assistance'. (v) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Homelessness Assistance' and replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Housing Information and Referral Assistance (occasions of service)'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for wording and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10'. (w) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Home Ownership and Renovation Assistance' and replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Number of new households assisted (including home renovation inspections as well as loans)'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for insertion of text 'to maintain or enter home ownership' and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (x) This is a new performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect the percentage of clients receiving homelessness support from a homelessness support agency who have a case plan, who have some, most or all of their case plan goals achieved. (y) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Home Ownership and Renovation Assistance' (z) This measure has been transferred from the discontinued output 'Homelessness Assistance' and replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Proportion of homelessness support episodes where an accommodation need was unable to be met'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for change to wording and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10.

FTE numbers were previously estimated by use of an ABS endorsed multiplier which has been discontinued. (b) This new performance measure for 2010-11 provides information on the Victorian Screen Industry Strategy. This measure will estimate and report the total number of 'views' of screen content (the number of times a Film Victoria funded production has been viewed in the year of its release). Notes (continued): (c) Variance between the 2009-10 Target and 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the rephasing of funding under the Industry Transition Fund to future years. Variance between the 2009-10 Target and 2010-11 Target reflects the year on year movements in annual funding for the Industry Transition Fund. (d) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the growth in business interactions during 2009-10. The 2009-10 Expected outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to higher than forecast use of online SmartForms that include features to speed lodgement and reduce errors. (e) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects an anticipated increased uptake for 2010. The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to increased demand for online services.

(b) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to the continued impact of the transfer of some records checking to the national agency, CrimTrac, and Commonwealth aged care legislation changes requiring checks to be conducted triennially. (c) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to a lower than anticipated demand for response. Factors impacting on the demand for police response to an event are outside the control of Victoria Police. Annual targets are set based on historic 'actual' trend analysis and represent an anticipated level of demand. (d) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome (2 per cent increase) is due to a rise in the total number of recorded 'assaults'. Police attendance at, and recorded assaults, in the context of Family Violence Incidents (FVI) have increased significantly relative to 2008-09. Victoria Police actively encourages the reporting of FVI, as part of a longer term strategy to reduce the incidence of family violence in the community. Assaults in public places (street assaults) have started to decrease relative to the same time in 2008-09. (e) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome (6 per cent reduction) is higher than the 2009-10 Target (2 per cent reduction) due to significant decreases in 'theft offences'. Decreases in theft of motor vehicles, theft from motor vehicles, and theft of bicycles, were the main contributors. Deception offences also significantly declined during 2009-10. (f) The 2010-11 target has been revised downwards, to better align with the historic (2006-07 to 2008-09) national average, for this performance measure as reported in the Productivity Commissions 'Report on Government Services' for 2008-09. (g) The 2010-11 Target is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to an increase in funding in the 2010-11 Budget for additional police and associated resources."

(b) The 2010-11 Target is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to a change in counting rules. In previous years, the annual Target included funded seminars, workshops and events, and an estimate for 'fee for service' demand. The 2010-11 Target excludes the 'fee for service' component, therefore better reflecting output funded service delivery. The VEOHRC will continue to report details of all community education/training programs, services and events delivered, in its annual report. (c) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to higher than anticipated 'fee for service' demand for training. (d) The change in target from 'number' to 'less than' better captures the intent of the target for this performance measure. Notes (continued): (e) The 2010-11 Target has not been changed despite historic higher than annual target performance, due to changes in counting rules in 2010-11. The changes will better capture degrees of customer satisfaction with services provided, and it is anticipated that the 'Target' and 'Actual' will be better aligned. (f) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome, reflects high levels of satisfaction with the delivery of VEOHRC education programs, services and events. (g) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to reallocation of resources to meet demand pressures in service delivery. This approach has delivered the positive 2009-10 Expected Outcome. (h) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects an anticipated level of activity created by a dedicated Diversity Officer, to promote, develop and implement a community engagement strategy for Victoria's culturally and linguistically diverse community and indigenous community. (i) The 2010-11 Target is higher than the 2009-10 Target to reflect service delivery levels funded by the Commonwealth via a Section 29 Financial Management Act (FMA) revenue retention agreement, Public Purpose Fund (PPF) payments, and state output appropriation. The 2009-10 Target excluded Commonwealth and PPF service delivery components. (j) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target as it reflects anticipated service delivery levels in line with the revised methodology for disclosing total funding in delivery of legal services. (k) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to lower than anticipated referrals from the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. (l) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to efficiency improvements. Procedural changes have delivered significant efficiency improvements, thereby increasing the number of investigations completed within two working days. (m) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to unprecedented demand as a consequence of the 2008-09 summer heat wave followed by the bushfires in February 2009. Additional resourcing is supporting completion of delayed reports. (n) The total output cost includes Victoria Legal Aid funding from two sources only; State output appropriation and Commonwealth National Partnership Payments. Public Purpose Fund payments of around $25 million per year also contribute to the delivery of Victoria Legal Aid outputs and these are reflected in the output quantity targets. (o) The 2009-10 performance measure 'State Government, Municipal and Non-government elections, by-elections and polls' has been replaced by the 2010-11 performance measure 'State elections, municipal and statutory elections, by-elections and polls'. The new performance measure excludes state by-elections, as these are funded separately and unscheduled, by their nature. (p) The 2010-11 Target reflects an anticipated level of activity incorporating the scheduling of parliamentary elections in November 2010, and anticipated statutory and fee-for-service elections. (q) The significant increase is due to additional funding for the 2010 State Election to be held in November 2010 as per the Electoral Act No. 23 2002."

Demand for 'Working with Children Checks' outside the target group is difficult to predict accurately.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Departmental mission statement The goal of the Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD) is to create liveable communities that are sustainable, connected and inclusive. To achieve this, DPCD provides research, policy and planning advice; administers legislation and regulations; invests in infrastructure and services and advocates for the needs of key population groups. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term The significant challenges facing DPCD include: \u2022 consolidating planning and introducing regulatory reforms to assist in the management of population growth and minimising the pressure it places on communities and services; \u2022 creating more liveable communities, including renewal of existing areas and making our suburbs and towns better places to reside in with access to diverse and affordable housing and better services; \u2022 expanding the opportunities for our increasingly diverse population to participate in social, civic and economic life and fostering respect; \u2022 responding to the needs of specific population groups; and \u2022 promoting shared approaches to the use of community infrastructure and working with communities, community organisations, councils and developers to improve coordination in the way facilities and infrastructure are planned and developed. Adapting to our challenges while maintaining Victoria's enviable reputation for liveability, a strong economy and quality of life, requires a significant and sustained effort across DPCD's eleven portfolios. Major policy decisions and directions The Department has an ongoing role in progressing the Government's vision for the state, Growing Victoria Together - a Vision for Victoria to 2010 and Beyond . In addition, the Department has an ongoing role in progressing Melbourne @ 5 million and Melbourne 2030 . The Department has maintained a strong focus on progressing A Fairer Victoria through the realisation of service delivery reforms, building human capital and expanding economic opportunities for all Victorians. The Department has the responsibility of developing and implementing the Government's new Respect Agenda. The Department has responsibility for advising the Government on various critical issues including land use planning, building policy, housing supply, heritage, facilitating development, the Community Support Fund, community enterprise and volunteering, family violence, Aboriginal affairs, Men's sheds, ageing, youth, sport and recreation development, local government and disability. The Respect Agenda portfolio was created in January 2010. The aim of this portfolio is to: \u2022 develop Government policy and new initiatives that promote respectful behaviour; \u2022 provide high-level coordination on the range of existing initiatives relating to Respect that are led by other Ministers; and \u2022 develop partnerships with other organisations, sectors and levels of Government to progress the Respect Agenda. A performance measure for the Respect Agenda is included in the Community Development output. A new Local Government Investigations and Compliance Inspectorate (LGI) was established within DPCD in September 2009. This administrative office is dedicated to ensuring Councils comply with the Local Government Act 1989 . Performance measures for the LGI are included in the Developing the Local Government Sector output. To deliver on these government priorities, the Department maintains a strong focus on these four strategic directions: \u2022 planning communities for growth and change; \u2022 investing in community infrastructure and heritage; \u2022 strengthening communities and promoting inclusion; and \u2022 building organisational performance. Ministerial portfolios The Department supports nine ministers across eleven portfolios - Planning, Community Development, Respect Agenda, Skills and Workforce Participation (Adult, Community and Further Education), Veterans' Affairs, Sport Recreation and Youth Affairs, Women's Affairs, Senior Victorians, Local Government, Community Services (Disability), and Aboriginal Affairs. Changes to the output structure There are no changes to the output structure for 2010-11. The discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the Department's 2010-11 output structure.

(b) The 2010-11 output grouping names have been amended for alignment with the Department's 2010-14 Corporate Plan. (c) The increase in the output cost for Planning from $129.1 million in 2009-10 to $152.6 million in 2010-11 is largely due to the estimated carryover of project funds for Revitalising Central Dandenong and Geelong CAD and also new initiatives contained in the 2010-11 State Budget . (d) The decrease in the output cost from the 2009-10 Target of $152.2 million to a 2009-10 Expected Outcome of $129.1 million is largely due to the carryover of project funds for Revitalising Central Dandenong and Geelong CAD projects. (e) The increase in the output cost is largely due to new initiatives contained in the 2010-11 State Budget . Refer to Appendix A for further details. (f) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to the Government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

(n) The increase in the output cost for Planning from $129.1 million in 2009-10 to $152.6 million in 2010-11 is largely due to the estimated carryover of project funds for Revitalising Central Dandenong and Geelong CAD and also new initiatives contained in the 2010-11 State Budget . (o) The decrease in the output cost from the 2009-10 Target of $152.2 million to a 2009-10 Expected Outcome of $129.1 million is largely due to the carryover of project funds for Revitalising Central Dandenong and Geelong CAD projects."

(b) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to more young people participating in the program. (c) The higher 2010-11 Target and 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflect the continued growth in popularity of the Youthcentral website due to the success of the site's search engine optimisation and strong general growth in the use of the Internet by young people. (d) This performance measure has been reworded as part of a Departmental review to achieve a consistent description of similarly worded performance measures. It measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (e) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the increasing program completion rates in previous years. (f) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to the higher levels of engagement by students undertaking the program. (g) The increase in output cost is largely due to new initiatives contained in the 2010-11 State Budget including 'A Right to Respect: Victoria's Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women' and 'Building women's financial independence'. (h) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects plans to increase consultation in 2010-11 on the Women's Policy Framework which ends in 2011. (i) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to additional consultations for the development of A Right to Respect: Victoria's Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women 2010-20. (j) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher that the 2009-10 Target due to the Victorian Disability Advisory Council (VDAC) convening an additional meeting in a Local Government Area. (k) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the re-phasing of the project to complete 190-200 histories over 4 years. (l) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to the re-phasing of the project. (m) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'New U3A memberships' to better reflect the replacement U3A growth program. (n) The lower 2010-11 Target reflects levels of participation in the program in recent years. (o) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to the level of participation despite increased marketing and promotion. (p) The 2010-11 performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Seniors activities grants programs: number approved'. The 2010-11 measure has been reworded to provide greater clarity and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (q) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Increase in membership of Stolen Generations Victoria' as funding to Stolen Generations Victoria has ceased and the organisation is no longer operating. (r) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the effect of the continuing completion of stage one community plans by the Local Indigenous Networks (LINs). (s) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the effect of the continuing adoption of single funding agreements by Government departments. (t) New performance measure for 2010-11 to quantify all Government-funded student contact hours delivered by ACE and Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) within the new Securing Jobs For Your Future environment. (u) The lower 2010-11 target reflects the introduction of a minimum module length (20 hours) which is anticipated to reduce the number of enrolments. (v) New performance measure for 2010-11 due to implementation of Compact with Young Australians (the Youth Compact) through Securing Jobs For Your Future. (w) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome and 2008-09 Actual is due to growth in the combat sports industry. (x) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome and 2008-09 Actual are due to additional events being won by the Victorian Government including by the Victorian Major Events Company. (y) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Commencement of urgent capital works at State Sports Centres Trust's facilities'. The 2010-11 performance measure relates to urgent capital works to be funded in 2010-11, associated with the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre. (z) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Construction continuing at the State sports facility project in Albert Park'. The 2010-11 performance measure better reflects the progress of the project."

(b) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect Government priority of promoting mutual respect in the community. (c) The Victorian Transport Plan announced $80 million for the extension of Transport Connections Program in October 2009. The 2010-11 Target relates to transport connection agreements executed in the initial year of the program (2010-11). (d) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Progress on implementation of actions in Strengthening Community Organisations Action Plan complies with agreed performance targets'. It has been amended to provide greater clarity. (e) The 2009-10 measure will be reported in 2010-11as a timeliness measure to provide greater clarity. It was previously reported as a quality measure. Notes (continued): (f) Includes an adjustment of $3.0 million for the Community Support Fund, being the difference between the estimated revenue of $105.0 million and estimated payment of $108.0 million in 2010-11 (2009-10 Expected Outcome $6.9 million: $101.1 million in revenue and $108.0 million expenditure). (g) The increase in the output cost is largely due to new initiatives contained in the 2010-11 Budget , including the 'Respect Agenda- Partnership Projects' and 'Transport Connections 2010-2020'. (h) The LGI was established in September 2009 and separated the investigation and audit function from Local Government Victoria (LGV). Both areas contribute to the same output. (i) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect Government priority of ensuring good governance and administration in local government through the establishment of LGI. (j) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect Government priorities regarding new funding received through the Reducing the Regulatory Burden Initiative. (k) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Living Libraries grants provided to improve public library services in partnership with local councils'. The 2010-11 measure has been reworded and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (l) The lower 2010-11 Target is due to larger projects being eligible for the maximum grant. (m) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to a greater number of smaller grants being provided to more councils. (n) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect commitment to consultation with stakeholders in decision making. (o) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Funding grants are provided within timeframes agreed with grant recipient'. The 2010-11 performance measure provides greater clarity and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (p) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Victoria Grants Commission payments are made within timeframes agreed with local councils'. The 2010-11 performance measure has been reworded to provide greater clarity and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10.

DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES Departmental mission statement The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) designs and delivers government policies and programs that enable Victoria's primary and energy industries to sustainably maximise the wealth and wellbeing they generate, by providing essential goods and services, employment, investment and recreational opportunities. DPI's role is primarily economic, ensuring that human needs are met from the State's natural resources through mostly privately owned sustainable industries operating in competitive and regulated markets. A focus on production and productivity is therefore central to DPI's work, but so too is a complementary focus on public and employee safety, community resilience, animal welfare and the natural environment. DPI is responsible for agriculture, earth resources, energy, fisheries and forestry in Victoria. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term Over the coming years Victoria's primary and energy industries will undergo major change, driven by challenges and opportunities such as: \u2022 climate change and water scarcity - driving substantial adaptation in primary industries, and greenhouse gas abatement and water efficiency in the energy sector; \u2022 global competition and trade - requiring continued growth in productivity; \u2022 changing community attitudes - driving more safe, clean and ethically sound practices, products and services as Victorians exert more influence over government decisions; and \u2022 demographic changes - presenting challenges and opportunities in rural and regional Victoria. Major policy decisions and directions DPI's strategies for 2008-11 reflect these challenges and opportunities, and the context in which the Department operates. They are: \u2022 develop a strategic policy framework: DPI will develop a comprehensive, integrated and long term strategic policy framework to build the productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of Victoria's primary and energy industries; \u2022 drive innovation in science, technology and practice: DPI will fund important research, development, demonstration, commercialisation and practice change in primary and energy industries that would not occur sufficiently if left entirely to the market; \u2022 develop and operate efficient markets and regulatory frameworks: DPI will enable the best use of Victoria's abundant natural resources by allocating them to productive uses, developing administered markets in downstream goods and services, enhancing primary producers' access to markets, and establishing and overseeing the regulation of primary and energy industries; \u2022 negotiate and facilitate major investments: DPI will assist developers of large energy and earth resources projects to understand and comply with approval processes, and play a key role in delivering major infrastructure investments that provide public benefits that would not occur without government involvement; \u2022 manage emergencies promptly and effectively: DPI will advise and implement the Government's response to a wide range of emergencies, notably biosecurity incursions and energy supply shortfalls, and provide considerable assistance in bushfire response and recovery work; and \u2022 achieve excellence in corporate and business management: Successful delivery of the above strategies depends on high quality, efficient business and corporate services. Ministerial portfolios DPI supports the ministerial portfolios of Energy and Resources, and Agriculture. Changes to the output structure There are no changes to the output structure for 2010-11. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost.

(b) The 2009-10 revised output cost is higher than the 2009-10 output cost due to additional funding for a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) pre-feasibility study and an internal realignment of the output costing structure. (c) The 2010-11 output cost is lower than the 2009-10 revised output cost mainly due to concluding initiatives such as Sustainable Transport Energy, Gippsland Regional Infrastructure Development and grants under the Victorian Renewable Energy Target scheme. (d) The 2010-11 output cost is higher than the 2009-10 output cost as a result of an internal realignment of the output costing structure. (e) The 2009-10 revised output cost is higher than the 2009-10 output cost due to additional funding for the response to Fruit Fly and Potato Cyst Nematode outbreaks and the internal realignment of the output costing structure. Notes (continued): (f) The 2009-10 revised output cost is lower than the 2009-10 output cost mainly due to carryover, offset by the revision to delivery timelines for Biosciences Research Centre which reflect the revised procurement model. (g) The 2010-11 output cost is higher than the 2009-10 revised output cost as a result of revised delivery timelines for Energy Technology Innovation Strategy projects such as Large Scale Demonstration and Large Scale Carbon Capture and Storage projects. (h) The 2009-10 revised output cost is higher than the 2009-10 output cost predominantly due to additional funding received for the 2009 drought package. (i) The 2010-11 output cost is lower than the 2009-10 revised output cost as a result of reduced demand for the Exceptional Circumstances Interest Rate Subsidy drought relief program and 2009-10 one-off additional funding for drought initiatives. (j) The 2010-11 output cost is lower than the 2009-10 output cost predominantly due to the reduced demand for the Exceptional Circumstances Interest Rate Subsidy drought relief program. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

(b) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to additional geoscience information released at the Resources Victoria Conference in August 2009 which was not included in the original target. (c) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to additional policy briefings being required on the potential impacts of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the national Renewable Energy Target on the State's electricity supply. (d) The decrease in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is a result of the rescheduling of the preparation of four fisheries management plans scheduled to be completed in the 2009-10 year. These are in production but will not be completed by the end of the financial year. (e) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects a higher than expected number of grant submissions being received and reviewed by the Department for the first half of the year. (f) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects a higher number of briefings in the following areas - large scale solar, the implementation of advanced metering, Victoria's contribution to national energy market reform and the commencement of the premium feed-in tariff scheme. (g) This is a new measure for 2010-11 to reflect progress in the Gippsland Basin project. (h) This is a new measure for 2010-11 which reflects the next stage of the Future Energy - large-scale Sustainable Energy demonstration program funded in the 2008-09 Budget . (i) This is a new measure for 2010-11 which reflects the next stage of the Future Energy - large-scale Carbon Capture and Storage demonstration program funded in the 2008-09 Budget . (j) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to the completion of additional high risk audits at sites across the state following the identification of potential high risk issues during routine inspections. (k) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to additional audits completed, which reflects some sites being audited twice, to ensure that risk issues identified in the initial audit phase have been adequately addressed. (l) The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 performance measure except for the addition of 'emergency' and measures the same activity as the performance measure in 2009-10. This change has been made to clarify that this measure refers to the response to pests and diseases specified under national agreements as requiring an urgent response. Notes (continued): (m) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to the number of applications for intellectual property protection for the period being greater than forecast due to patenting and business strategy decisions. There are three patents which relate to a single plant technology and 5 patents which relate to a single bioactive compound. The eight additional provisional patents have been filed from 2 'discoveries'. The 2010-11 Target has been increased in line with the 2009-10 Expected Outcome and the historical performance of this measure. (n) The 2010-11 Target has been increased to reflect the progress of the project. (o) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is mostly due to an additional 15 employees in the Future Farming Systems Research area currently undertaking PhD's, who were not included in the published target. (p) The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 performance measure except for the addition of 'or' and measures the same activity as the performance measure in 2009-10. (q) The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 performance measure 'Farm clients facing significant adjustment pressures are case managed to make better informed and more timely decisions' however the wording has been amended for greater clarity. The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to capability having increased during the year, with the fixed-term appointment of a second Rural Financial Counsellor by Goulburn Murray Hume Agcare. (r) The 2010-11 Target has been decreased with the completion of some associated fixed term funding for these activities at the end of 2009-10 and in line with the planned work program for 2010-11. Work is underway to assess demand and funding requirements going forward. (s) This is a new measure for 2010-11 to reflect an increased emphasis on productivity and evaluation in the Farm Services area. (t) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to more significant stakeholder interactions than initially planned, due to increased capacity in the DPI delivery team. (u) The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 performance measure except for the addition of 'Targeted areas' and removal of 'Farming communities' and measures the same activity as the performance measure in 2009-10. The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome is due to a plan to deliver up to two more forums than initially anticipated over the whole year. (v) This is a new measure to replace the discontinued measure 'Case managed irrigation connections undertaken'. The focus of this measure is to facilitate adjustment by ensuring as many irrigators as possible participate in the relevant programs, understand their options and take advantage of opportunities presented. (w) The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 performance measure 'Satisfaction of clients with services provided' however the wording has been amended to better reflect activities performed. (x) This measure now incorporates the 2009-10 measure 'Practice change and technical publications submitted to conference proceedings and peer review journal' which referred to the number of publications submitted. (y) The 2010-11 Target is lower than the 2009-10 Expected Outcome as a result of reduced demand for the Exceptional Circumstances Interest Rate Subsidy drought relief program and 2009-10 one-off additional funding for drought initiatives. DEPARTMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT Departmental mission statement The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) is Victoria's primary government agency responsible for promoting and managing the sustainability of the natural environment. The department's primary functions are: \u2022 water management; \u2022 public land fire management; \u2022 climate change and greenhouse policy; \u2022 nature and biodiversity conservation; \u2022 public land stewardship across forests, coasts, alpine resorts, Crown land reserves and parks; and \u2022 promotion of sustainable resource use and management practices by industry and the general community. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term The ongoing impact of climate change, particularly longer, more intense drought periods combined with lower average rainfall and increased temperatures, remains the most significant challenge facing the department in the medium term. The severity and longevity of the current drought significantly increases the risk of severe fire danger and large bushfire outbreaks. In response to last year's devastating February bushfires, the government is implementing a range of bushfire relief measures and the recovery of bushfire affected areas remains a major priority of the department as well as across government. Water scarcity is another key challenge for the department. The Department is focused on delivering policies and projects to provide water security for Victoria's growing population and economy. Major policy directions and strategies In response to the major challenges and opportunities faced by the state, the department's strategic priorities include: \u2022 securing our water resources into the future; \u2022 responding to the increasing fire threat; \u2022 promoting new standards for protecting the natural environment; and \u2022 adapting effectively to the impacts of climate change. Securing our Natural Future - a white paper for land and biodiversity at a time of climate change , released in December 2009, sets the direction for Victorian Government policy and investment priorities in natural resource management, land health and biodiversity for the next 20-50 years. The Victorian Government continues to lead the way in climate change action. The Victorian Climate Change Green Paper , released June 2009, proposes ways Victoria can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change and become a leading low carbon economy. Following this, the Victorian Climate Change White Paper will set out a comprehensive new climate change strategy for the State. On 19 June 2007, the Victorian Government released Our Water Our Future: the Next Stage of the Government's Water Plan , which provides long term solutions to secure Victoria's water supplies. Major projects announced at that time, worth in excess of $4 billion, remain on track for urgent delivery. These strategic priorities provide the context for service delivery by the department under the following outcomes: \u2022 healthy and productive water systems; \u2022 healthy and productive land; \u2022 healthy, productive and accessible marine, coastal and estuarine systems; \u2022 flourishing biodiversity in healthy ecosystems; \u2022 clean air, liveable climate; \u2022 less waste, less pollution; and \u2022 land information and property information. Ministerial portfolios The department supports the ministerial portfolios of Water, and Environment and Climate Change. Changes to the output structure The department has not made any changes to its output structure in 2010-11. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the department's 2010-11 output structure and therefore allocations may differ from the department's previously published budget. Table 3.9: Output summary ($ million) 2009-10 Budget 2009-10 2010-11 Budget Variation (a) % Revised Healthy and Productive Water Systems (b) 389.4 348.3 327.7 -15.8 Healthy and Productive Land; Healthy, Productive and Accessible Marine, Coastal and Estuarine Systems; and Flourishing Biodiversity in Healthy Ecosystems 676.8 772.9 695.1 2.7 Less Waste, Less Pollution; and Clean Air, Liveable Climate 195.9 191.2 190.5 -2.8 Land Administration and Property Information (c) 125.5 130.5 132.7 5.7 Total (d) 1 387.6 1 442.9 1 346.0 -3.0 Source: Department of Sustainability and Environment Notes: (a) Variation between 2009-10 Budget and 2010-11 Budget. (b) The decrease largely reflects amounts passed on as part of the Public Private Partnership contract for the Victorian Desalination Project during 2009-10. These amounts include early preparatory works contracted by the Government and costs of the Independent Reviewer and Environmental Auditor contract. (c) The 2010-11 Budget reflects the increase in demand for services due to the rebounding of the Victorian property market. (d) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

(b) This performance measure amends the 2009-10 performance measure 'Crown land licenses issued'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except it refers to licenses managed as opposed to licenses issued. It has been edited to more accurately reflect the work of the department and measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. (c) 2009-10 Expected Outcome and the 2010-11 Target are higher than the 2009-10 Target as the performance measure has now been amended to include temporary Apiary licences and licences managed under the Forest Act 1958 and National Parks Act 1975 . (d) The 2010-11 Target is lower than the 2009-10 Target and 2009-10 Expected Outcome primarily due to the transfer of Local Ports to the Department of Transport. (e) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect Government priorities regarding native vegetation planning processes. (f) 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the area covered by landscape change projects being expanded in response to the success of the projects and priorities identified in the recently launched Securing Our Natural Future - A white paper for land and biodiversity at a time of climate change . (g) 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to an additional regional landscape change project in the North Central catchment region commencing in 2009-10. (h) 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target as the planning for this year includes some bridges and crossings that were not completed in 2008-09 as a result of the diversion of resources to the fire suppression effort following the 2009 Bushfires. (i) 2010-11 Target represents the total number of bridges replaced or repaired to enable safe access for rapid bushfire response, tourism and commercial operators since the program's inception in 2008-09. (j) This target is under review and the final outcome will be determined following the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission's final report. (k) The 2008-09 Actual has increased as compared to the measure reported in the 2009 DSE Annual Report. The DSE Annual Report was based on an estimate as at June 2009, and does not include planned burns conducted late in the 2008-09 year. (l) 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to fluctuations with natural attrition and the recruitment of new staff. (m) 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target as a result of changes to the documentation system for inspections which required staff to retrain and populate the system. (n) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target as a result of the 2009 Fire Recovery Program requiring additional works to reinstate road condition and fire access which has impacted on the capacity of field road staff to inspect the Category 1 roads as scheduled. Notes (continued): (o) The performance measure 'number of personnel accredited to serve in a senior capacity (level 2 or 3) in a fire role' replaces the 2009-10 performance measure ' proportion of personnel accredited to serve in a senior capacity (level 2 or 3) in a fire role'. It has been replaced to more accurately report on personnel accredited to serve in a senior fire role, as the former measure was influenced by periods of high recruitment in the lead up to the bushfire season. (p) The variation in output cost is primarily due to the once off funding provided in 2009-10 for fire preparedness and response activities. (q) This performance measure amends the 2009-10 performance measure 'Parks managed by Parks Victoria, assessed as high priority for weed and pest control'. The amended performance measure reports on the percentage of parks or sites assessed as being high priority, (using Levels of Protection analysis) for weeds and fox control (having control programs) and rabbit control (having control or monitoring programs). The amended performance measure reflects current environmental values and project priorities. (r) This performance measure amends the 2009-10 performance measure 'Visitors to Parks Victoria managed estate'. The amended performance measure more accurately captures the level of visitation to the Parks Victoria managed estate. (s) The increase in the 2010-11 Target compared with the 2009-10 Target follows the Government's announcement removing park entry fees from Victoria's national and metropolitan parks. (t) This performance measure amends the 2009-10 performance measure 'Bay assets with greater than five years life expectancy'. The amended performance measure more accurately reflects the condition and quality of Victoria's bay assets. (u) 2009-10 Expected Outcome and the 2010-11 Target are lower than the 2009-10 Target due to an increasing number of ageing maritime assets. Additionally, primary structures and surrounding coastal landscapes are being subjected to increased storm ferocity resulting from climate change. (v) This performance measure amends the 2009-10 performance measure 'Park assets with a life expectancy greater than five years'. The amended performance measure more accurately reflects the condition and quality of Victoria's park assets. (w) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome and the 2010-11 Target are lower than the 2009-10 Target due to an increasing number of facilities requiring repair or replacement. In some areas work priorities for recreation facilities have been focused on bushfire suppression. (x) The 'Forests and Parks' output cost commenced in 2009-10 and therefore there is no 2008-09 Actual to report."

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT Departmental mission statement The Department of Transport's mission is to build a safer, fairer and greener transport system for all Victorians to create a more prosperous and connected community. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term The Department of Transport's challenges include: \u2022 developing integrated transport and land-use policy responses that will bring employment and other services closer to where people live to enhance liveability and support sustainable population growth across the State; \u2022 building the capacity of the statewide public transport system, maintaining its infrastructure and providing more services to manage growing patronage and reduce overcrowding; \u2022 maintaining and building road infrastructure to reduce congestion, improve safety and close gaps in the network; \u2022 managing increased demand for freight movements on the transport system and mitigating the impact on Victorian communities; and \u2022 promoting and removing barriers to sustainable travel options. Major policy decisions and directions The Victorian Transport Plan and Melbourne @ 5 million share the vision of better integrating transport and land-use planning to increase the supply of well-located homes, businesses and services. They aim to reduce the distance of passenger and freight travel, reduce congestion and enable transport infrastructure to be used more efficiently while minimising environmental and social impacts on Victorian communities. They are supported by specific policies including Freight Futures, Port Futures, the Victorian Cycling Strategy and arrive alive !. In response to the strategic directions of these plans and policies, the Department of Transport is committed to achieving significant results against the following priorities: Integrate transport and land-use planning Work in partnership with other departments and agencies to integrate transport networks and services with plans for the future shape of Melbourne and Victoria, develop and implement legislation that supports transport priorities, and secure strategic land reservations for future transport needs. Support the Victorian economy with an effective and resilient transport network Contribute to maintaining Victoria's competitiveness and productivity by delivering an effective and resilient transport system by expanding capacity and improving the system's efficiency, accessibility and service quality. Ensure safety for all transport users Improve actual safety and public perceptions of the safety and security of Victoria's roads, public transport and waterways, and reduce the incidence and severity of accidents. Improve the sustainability of Victorian transport Minimise transport's impact on the environment by promoting more sustainable travel choices, increasing the efficiency of the transport fleet, and ensuring that transport infrastructure can withstand the effects of climate change. Build a collaborative and effective organisation Position the Department to deliver its objectives by continuing to transform its culture to foster open and collaborative work, building its capacity to engage with stakeholders and improving its internal processes. Ministerial portfolios The Department supports the ministerial portfolios of Public Transport, and Roads and Ports. Changes to the output structure The Department has made a change to its output structure in 2010-11 as shown in the table below: 2010-11 Outputs Reason 2009-10 Outputs Transport Security and Emergency Management Title Change Infrastructure Security and Emergency Management The Infrastructure Security and Emergency Management output in 2009-10 was renamed to Transport Security and Emergency Management to better reflect the linkage to transport initiatives. The responsibility for Victoria's local ports will be transferred from the Department of Sustainability and Environment in 2010-11 to the Department of Transport. This change has been reflected in the current output statement. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. Table 3.10: Output summary ($ million) 2009-10 Budget 2009-10 Revised 2010-11 Budget Variation (a) % Transport Safety and Security (b)(c) 388.6 393.6 342.9 -11.8 Public Transport Services (d) 3 015.2 3 364.2 3 805.6 26.2 Integrated Transport Planning, Delivery and Management 1 364.9 1 422.4 1 380.6 1.2 Total (e) 4 768.7 5 180.2 5 529.1 15.9 Source: Department of Transport Notes: (a) Variation between 2009-10 Budget and 2010-11 Budget. (b) The Public Safety and Security output group in 2009-10 was renamed to Transport Safety and Security to better reflect the linkage to transport initiatives. (c) The reduction in the 2010-11 Budget is primarily due to the completion of projects provided for under the Commonwealth Government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan (Blackspots Program). (d) The increase in the 2009-10 Revised and 2010-11 Budget reflects the additional investment in public transport. In addition under the new Franchise Agreement from 30 November 2009 all fare revenue is received by the State and paid to rail operators. Under the previous Franchise Agreement, the rail operators received fare revenue directly. (e) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended to accurately reflect the activity being measured. Notes (continued): (b) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Bus safety accreditation compliance audits/inspections conducted in accordance with regulatory policy'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended for consistency with the Bus Safety Act 2009 (Vic) . (c) The 2010-11 Target differs to the 2009-10 Target due to the completion of level crossing projects provided for under the Commonwealth Government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan (Boom Gates for Rail Crossings Program). (d) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to an acceleration of the level crossing program. (e) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Train and tram safety compliance audits/inspections conducted in accordance with legislative requirements'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended for consistency with the Rail Safety Act 2006 (Vic) . (f) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Bus safety non-compliance reports addressed within agreed timeframes by accredited operators'. The Bus Safety Act 2009 (Vic) will give Public Transport Safety Victoria (PTSV) strengthened compliance and enforcement tools in relation to monitoring bus safety, including improvement notices. PTSV will therefore monitor and report on improvement notices instead of non-compliance reports. (g) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Train and tram safety Improvement Notices addressed within agreed timeframes by accredited operators'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended for consistency with the Rail Safety Act 2006 (Vic) . (h) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Bus safety accreditations processed on time'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended for consistency with the Bus Safety Act 2009 (Vic) . (i) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Train and tram accreditations processed on time'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended for consistency with the Rail Safety Act 2006 (Vic) . (j) The 2010-11 Target differs to the 2009-10 Target due to the completion of projects provided for under the Commonwealth Government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan (Blackspots Program). (k) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome differs to the 2009-10 Target following detailed assessment of the target projects provided for under the Commonwealth Government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. (l) The higher 2010-11 Target is due to an increase in the expected projects planned for 2010-11. (m) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the identification and inclusion of additional motorcycle levy road improvement projects. (n) The higher 2010-11 Target is due to an increase in the number of vehicle registration and vehicle safety initiatives and projects planned in 2010-11. (o) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the inclusion of rest areas and national reform projects. (p) The reduction in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects a reclassification of activities between operating and capital. (q) New performance measure reflecting the call taking service provided by the Victorian Taxi Directorate. (r) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the expected increase in licence renewals due to the additional licence terms available to customers (i.e. three, six and ten year licences). (s) The 2010-11 Target and 2009-10 Expected Outcome are higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the added capacity to deliver more drive tests following the launch of the Graduated Licensing System. (t) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Commercial passenger vehicles inspected - taxis, hire cars etc'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure but has been amended to better describe the focus of inspection activities. (u) The higher 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the completion of the taxi audit and plate exchange project in 2009-10. (v) New performance meaure reflecting the taxi driver accreditation service provided by the Victorian Taxi Directorate. (w) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to a large increase in registration search requests by ConnectEast resulting from increased usage of EastLink. The 2010-11 Target assumes a continued increase in use of both CityLink and EastLink and the associated registration search requests. (x) An improved methodology is used to calculate customer satisfaction index score in 2010-11. Therefore the 2010-11 Target is not comparable with previous targets and outcomes. (y) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is attributable to unforeseen booking and payments systems related problems in 2009-10. (z) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Taxi service complaints investigated and closed'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure but has been amended to better reflect the activity being measured. Notes (continued): (aa) The 2010-11 Target is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the advertising of the Victorian Taxi Directorate call centre and website, to increase the awareness among taxi passengers on how to lodge complaints. (ab) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to a public media campaign promoting the taxi complaints process to community groups in 2009-10. This level of complaints is expected to return to normal levels in 2010-11. (ac) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Taxis conform to quality standards'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure but has been reworded to better describe complaint assessment activities. (ad) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is expected to be higher than the 2009-10 Target due to continuous improvement in customer service. Revised customer surveys are being developed to support this continuous improvement. (ae) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2008-09 Actual as a result of the VicRoads customer service improvement program, but is still lower than the 2009-10 Target due to the higher than expected growth in licensing and registration transactions and drive tests placing considerable pressure on the Service Centres' service levels. This is expected to improve in 2010-11 with the implementation of an automated Queue Management System. (af) This measure replaces the previous measure 'Taxi service complaints investigated and closed within 30 days of receipt', with a target of 60 per cent. The 2010-11 Target for the new performance measure has been increased to >85 per cent reflecting a reduction of the number of investigated complaints that remain open. (ag) The increase in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome primarily reflects additional spending on taxi initiatives. (ah) This measure replaces the previous measure 'All relevant registered training organisations and training providers audited'. Commercial registered training organisations and their training providers will be audited in 2010-11. The audit program for recreational registered training organisations and training providers is undertaken every two years and is next scheduled for 2011-12. (ai) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Commercial vessels surveyed annually'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended to accurately reflect the activity being measured. (aj) This new performance measure reflects the legislative responsibility for the promotion of marine safety education across the boating community. (ak) The 2010-11 Target has been increased to 100 per cent due to the consistent achievement of 100 per cent over the past three years. (al) In 2009-10, 100 per cent of multiple safety system failures are expected to be investigated due to the fact that they differed in nature. Where a number of accidents have the same multiple safety system failures, a proportion of those accidents are investigated. (am) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome differs to the 2009-10 Target due to the need for extensive technical research and input into some investigations. (an) The reduction in the 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the reclassification of some activities to the 'Marine Safety and Regulation' output. (ao) The 2010-11 Target is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to the targets being exceeded over the last two years and now better reflects the level of activity being measured. (ap) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to an increase in State level emergency planning and coordination meetings including bushfire preparedness. (aq) The 2010-11 Target reflects better exercise management synchronisation with other State Government agencies and more efficient use of time and resources. (ar) Exercise management resources have been redirected to assist Victoria Police with planning and executing the National Counter Terrorism Committee (NCTC) exercise, Mercury 2010. These resources would normally be for planning a second major Department of Transport led exercise. (as) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to increased regional exercises with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to support bushfire preparedness. (at) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Initiation of agreed recommendations in response to infrastructure security and/or emergency management reviews'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except that the terminology has been amended to accurately reflect the activity being measured and it is now being reported as a quality measure."

(b) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome differs to the 2009-10 Target due to patronage growth being less than estimated. (c) Increased payments in 2009-10 and 2010-11 reflect the additional investment in public transport under the new Franchise Agreement. In addition, from 30 November 2009 all fare revenue is received by the State and paid to rail operators. Under the previous Franchise Agreement, the rail operators received fare revenue directly. (d) This measure is based on the new reliability measure, which accounts for service cancellations, short services and bypass events (train only). Service delivery results before and after 30 November 2009 are not directly comparable. (e) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the introduction of new SmartBus services and bus service improvements in 2010-11. (f) An improved methodology is used to calculate customer satisfaction index score in 2010-11. Therefore the 2010-11 Target is not comparable with previous targets and outcomes. (g) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Rolling stock annual plan meets specifications in the Partnership Agreements'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for changes in wording to better reflect the activity undertaken, and measures the exact same activity as per performance measure in 2009-10. (h) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Bus services within five minutes of timetable'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as in 2009-10 and defines bus service punctuality to be within five minutes of timetable. (i) The new punctuality measure is defined in the new Franchise Agreement as services arriving 'no more than 59 seconds before and no more than four minutes 59 seconds after' the timetable. Punctuality measures in Franchise Agreements before and after 30 November 2009 are not directly comparable. (j) The new punctuality measure is defined in the new Franchise Agreement as services passing key monitoring points 'no earlier than 59 seconds before, and no later than four minutes and 59 seconds after' the timetable. Punctuality measures in Franchise Agreements before and after 30 November 2009 are not directly comparable. (k) Increased payments in 2009-10 and 2010-11 reflect the additional investment in public transport. In addition under the new Franchise Agreement, from 30 November 2009 all fare revenue is received by the State and paid to rail operators. Under the previous Franchise Agreement, the rail operators received fare revenue directly. (l) The 2008-09 Actual corrects a typographical error in the Department of Transport Annual Report 2008-09. (m) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is attributed to the use of rail replacement coaches on some V/Line train lines in 2009. Notes (continued): (n) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Rolling stock annual plan meets specifications in the Rolling Stock Management Plan for V/Line trains'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for changes in wording to better reflect the activity undertaken, and measures the exact same activity as per performance measure in 2009-10. (o) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Country bus services within five minutes of timetable'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as in 2009-10 and defines country bus service punctuality to be within five minutes of timetable. (p) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'Rail services arriving at destination no more than five minutes 59 seconds after timetable for short distance services and 10 minutes 59 seconds for long distance services'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as the 2009-10 measure except for a simplification to the wording of the measure. (q) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome differs to the 2009-10 Target due to a combination of extreme weather, heat related speed restrictions, infrastructure and train faults and congestion on the metropolitan network. (r) The 2010-11 Target reflects the completion of the current level access tram stops projects. (s) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome differs to the 2009-10 Target due to pending outcomes of design compliance assessments, resulting in a reduction to the total stops expected to be completed in 2009-10. The balance of these stops is now forecast to be completed in 2010-11. (t) New performance measure reflects the activities to be undertaken in 2010-11. (u) New performance measure reflecting use of the Multi Purpose Taxi Program. (v) The higher 2010-11 Target reflects the effect of 330 Wheelchair Accessible Taxi licences to be released in 2010. (w) The 2010-11 Target and 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the ongoing impact of the increased complexity and costs associated with site treatments. (x) This performance measure replaces the 2009-10 performance measure 'School bus services within five minutes of timetable'. The 2010-11 performance measure is the same as in 2009-10 and defines school bus service punctuality to be within five minutes of timetable."

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY AND FINANCE Departmental mission statement The Department of Treasury and Finance's mission is to provide leadership in economic, financial and resource management reform. This contributes to the Growing Victoria Together goal of sound financial management. Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term Significant challenges facing the Department in the medium term include: \u2022 ensuring Victoria can continue to respond to the impacts of the global financial crisis; \u2022 delivering the agenda of national economic and business reform agreed by the Council of Australian Governments; \u2022 investing in strategies to mitigate the influence of climate change; \u2022 facilitating the investment in and delivery of major infrastructure projects; \u2022 delivering comprehensive financial management reform; \u2022 delivering government services more efficiently; and \u2022 improving Victoria's business cost and tax competitiveness. Major policy directions and strategies The Department has established three objectives, which guide its policy directions to achieve the outcome of sound financial management: \u2022 maintain a substantial budget operating surplus that allows for the delivery of the Government's infrastructure objectives; \u2022 guide government actions to best increase living standards for all Victorians; and \u2022 champion an integrated whole of government 'value for money' approach to ensure optimal service delivery and the provision of world class infrastructure to benefit all Victorians. In addition to focusing on the delivery of its objectives during 2010-11, the Department will place additional emphasis on several strategic priorities: \u2022 continuing to progress opportunities for economic, financial and resource management reform in the areas of health, education, infrastructure and the environment; \u2022 driving frameworks and accountability for delivery of outputs, projects and services; \u2022 increasing the efficiency of necessary economic and business regulation reform; \u2022 increasing the use of market-based solutions especially in government services and natural resource industries; \u2022 improving the efficiency of administrative services across the public sector; and \u2022 systematically improving the Department's processes to ensure high quality advice to Government. Ministerial portfolios The Department supports the ministerial portfolios of Treasury, Finance, WorkCover and the Transport Accident Commission. The Department has not made any changes to its output structure in 2010-11. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the Department's 2010-11 output structure and therefore allocations may differ from the Department's previously published budget.

(c) The 2010-11 Budget includes funding to deliver the State Resource Information Management System. (d) The 2010-11 Budget decrease is due to lower capital asset charges based on the fixed assets attributable to this output group. (e) The 2010-11 Budget decrease is due to the lower output funding level required for the implementation of the Efficient Technology Services initiative and lower fixed assets related expenses. (f) The 2010-11 Budget decrease is resulting from the completion of the implementation of the Victorian Renewable Energy Target Scheme. (g) The 2010-11 Budget reflects the biennial purchase of municipal land valuations resulting in lower amortisation expense in the first year. (h) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to Government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Department can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

PARLIAMENT Departmental mission statement The Parliament of Victoria, through its elected representatives, is accountable to the Victorian community for the provision and conduct of representative government in the interests of Victorians. The Departments of the Parliament of Victoria deliver apolitical, professional and innovative services to support our elected representatives and the Parliament as an institution. The Departments of the Parliament of Victoria include: \u2022 the Department of the Legislative Council; \u2022 the Department of the Legislative Assembly; and \u2022 the Department of Parliamentary Services. The goals of the Departments of the Parliament of Victoria are to: \u2022 provide effective corporate governance; \u2022 ensure excellent service delivery and efficiency of response; and \u2022 ensure the sustainability of the business processes of Parliament into the future. Victoria's Constitution Act 1975 provides that the Auditor-General is an independent officer of Parliament. For budgetary purposes, the Victorian Auditor-General's Office is included as an output classification within Parliament. The main purpose of the Victorian Auditor-General's Office is to provide assurance to Parliament on the accountability and performance of the Victorian public sector. Significant challenges facing the Parliament in the medium term The key challenges facing the Parliament, including the Victorian Auditor-General's Office are: \u2022 planning for the end of the 56th Parliament and the commencement of a new Parliament; \u2022 delivering the video broadcasting of Parliamentary sessions in the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly; \u2022 delivering the appropriate services requested by the Parliament within existing resources; \u2022 ensuring that Parliament House remains a functional working location that is accessible to the public within security constraints; \u2022 expanding of the Community Engagement program; \u2022 implementing the Electorate Officers Enterprise Agreement within existing resources; \u2022 training and retention of staff specialising in Parliamentary procedure; and \u2022 recruitment and retention of skilled audit staff in the Victorian Auditor-General's Office to meet the increasing complexity of audit effort. This results from changed models of Government investment and partnering, along with increased requirements of the Auditing Standards. Major policy directions and strategies The Parliament is committed to remaining an organisation that: \u2022 provides a venue to allow the people's representatives to participate in the democratic process; \u2022 promotes sound financial management; and \u2022 provides a safe workplace. Broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings has been a significant ongoing project undertaken by the Parliament. This project will allow the Victorian public to have greater access to the proceedings of their Parliament. The Parliament has not made any changes to its output structure in 2010-11. However, the Parliament has made changes to some of its performance measures to ensure that measures reflect community and stakeholders interests. Discontinued performance measures are detailed in Appendix C of this budget paper. The following table summarises the total output cost. It has been prepared on the basis of the Parliament's 2010-11 output structure. Table 3.12: Output summary ($ million) 2009-10 Budget 2009-10 Revised 2010-11 Budget Variation (a) % Legislative Council 15.8 16.2 16.3 3.2 Legislative Assembly 29.7 30.5 30.7 3.4 Parliamentary Services 74.9 68.8 77.8 3.9 Parliamentary Investigatory Committees (b) 6.4 6.6 6.9 7.8 Victorian Auditor-General's Office 33.7 34.2 34.4 2.1 Total (c) 160.5 156.3 166.1 3.5 Source: Parliament of Victoria Notes: (a) Variation between 2009-10 Budget and 2010-11 Budget. (b) The total output cost for Parliamentary Investigatory Committees in 2010-11 has increased by 7.8 per cent compared with 2009-10. This is a result of additional funding provided for the appointment of an independent auditor to conduct a performance audit of the Victoria Auditor-General's office as required by the Audit Act 1994 (Vic) . (c) Total output expense may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements due to additional expenses in Budget Paper No. 4 that are not included in departmental output costs. The following section provides details of the outputs to be provided to government, including performance measures and costs for each output. Total expenditure for the Parliament can be found in Budget Paper No. 4, Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements."

The 2010-11 performance measure measures the same activity as per the performance measure in 2009-10. The change simply clarifies who is measured. (c) New performance measure for 2010-11 to reflect the existence of different stakeholder groups for which satisfaction is measured. (d) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to the continual protracted delays in obtaining necessary information from agencies, and in clearance of agency responses to draft reports. (e) The 2010-11 Target is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to: (i) the exclusions of stand-alone community health centres; and (ii) a reduction in the number of education and health entities being audited. (f) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to the exclusion of stand-alone community health centres. The lower 2009-10 Expected Outcome reflects the alignment with internal business plans."

(b) Liquor licensing fees includes application fees (Department of Justice) and renewal fees (State Revenue Office). Land tax exemption for retirement villages and other residential care facilities The Government has extended the current land tax exemption for retirement villages, residential care facilities, supported residential services and residential services for people with disabilities to include the construction phase of these facilities (for a maximum construction period of two years). Extending the land tax exemption will reduce the cost of developing these facilities, encourage private investment and help to improve the accessibility and affordability of such facilities for Victorians. Landfill levy On 24 March 2010, the Government announced that it would help businesses, councils, households and communities to address waste and its environmental impacts over the next five years through reinvestment into waste and resource recovery and other environmental priorities. The funding will be made available through increases to landfill levies, a charge placed on the delivery of materials to landfill sites. Liquor licensing fees The Government has introduced a risk-based liquor licensing fee structure to recognise the cost of regulating licensed venues. Under the new fee structure, introduced from 1 January 2010, licensed venues presenting more risk of harm to the community will pay higher liquor licence fees. The additional revenue will be used to recover the cost of liquor licence inspection, policing and enforcement activities. Metropolitan improvement levy The rate was increased in 2009-10. Each year there is also an adjustment for CPI, as is the case for all fees and charges. Revenue from the metropolitan improvement levy is used for state managed metropolitan parks and open space and will fund a range of improvements to parks, waterways and bays in the Melbourne metropolitan area including the Point Nepean Quarantine Station, Yarra Bend Park, Frankston Reservoir Park and the Dingley chain of parks. Motor vehicle duty threshold harmonisation From 1 July 2010, the duty threshold for charging a higher rate of duty for new passenger cars will be aligned with the Commonwealth luxury car tax threshold. This harmonisation will reduce the complexity of motor vehicle taxation in Victoria. Payroll tax The 2010-11 Budget reduces the payroll tax rate by a further 0.05 percentage points from 4.95 per cent to 4.90 per cent, effective from 1 July 2010. Costing $193 million over four years, this cut is the seventh cut to payroll tax announced by this government which has seen the payroll tax rate drop to 4.90 per cent down from the 5.75 per cent rate of the previous government. This cut gives Victoria the second lowest rate of any state and means around 31 000 businesses will benefit from this reduction. It also means that businesses in Victoria with payrolls between $5.5 million and $18 million will pay the lowest payroll tax in Australia."

Economic growth is not an end in itself. It is important because it creates good jobs, which, in turn, generate improved living standards and opportunities. There will be more and better jobs across Victoria Improvement over time in the quality and number of jobs available in Victoria can be measured by growth in employment and occupation types. Employment growth Over the period from 1999-2000 to 2008-09, Victoria averaged annual employment growth of 2.1 per cent (see Chart B.1). During the same period, the total number of jobs created was 460 000 (seasonally adjusted data). In 2008-09, annual employment growth was only 0.2 per cent due to the impact of the global financial crisis. Employment has since started to recover and year-to-date was 2.2 per cent higher than the 2008-09 average level.

Strong employment growth since 1999-2000 has contributed to a rise in the employment rate (the employed proportion of the working age population). In 2008-09 the average annual employment rate was 61.3 per cent, lower than the 62.3 per cent in 2007-08 but higher than the 58.5 per cent in 1999-2000. Underemployment Underemployment is defined as the proportion of employed persons in the labour force who want, and are available for, more hours of work than they currently have. Victoria's underemployment rate increased from 6.3 per cent in December 1999 to 7.7 per cent in March 2010 (Chart B.2). Although underemployment had increased since December 1999, the unemployment rate has decreased from 6.6 per cent in 1999-2000 to 5.1 per cent in 2008-09.

Nos. 6265.0 and 6202.0) Note: (a) The underemployment rate is calculated as the ratio of underemployed persons to the labour force. Employment in regional Victoria Employment in regional Victoria (the area outside Melbourne Statistical Division) has grown steadily over the last 10 years, increasing by 125 500 persons to reach 687 900 in December 2009 (see Chart B.3). Regional Victoria's share of total Victorian employment has averaged 25.6 per cent since 2000. The sharp jump in regional employment over the last year is consistent with the overall increase in employment in the state.

(b) Three monthly moving average data. Employment growth by occupation in Victoria Managers and professionals experienced the greatest increases in employment of all the occupations from 1999 to 2009, and account for over half (53.2 per cent) of the employment growth across all occupations. These occupations generally require higher levels of skills and educational attainment, and attract higher wages. After managers and professionals, community and personal service workers experienced the next highest percentage growth (14.4 per cent), reflecting the growth of the services sector in the economy (see Chart B.4).

Employment growth by industry Health Care and Social Assistance has experienced the greatest increase in employment numbers, increasing by 108 500 workers over the period 1999 to 2009. This is followed by Construction (76 000), Education and Training (59 300), and Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (48 300). Mining experienced the greatest percentage increase of growth over the period, with employment increasing by 165 per cent, although the actual number of people employed in the industry is very small. After Mining, Arts and Recreation Services (68 per cent), Electrical, Gas, Water and Waste Services (58 per cent), and Health Care and Social Assistance (58 per cent) experienced the greatest levels of growth in employment between 1999 and 2009. Manufacturing employment declined between 1999 and 2009, although it remained Victoria's largest employing industry (303 750 people), followed by Health Care and Social Assistance (294 250 people), and Retail Trade (291 500 people).

Victoria's productivity and competitiveness will increase One of the drivers of a modern and flexible economy is a productive workforce. In Australia, a state's productivity is usually measured by gross state product (GSP) per employed person or per hour worked. GSP is defined as the total economic output of the state, including all value that is added by industries in that state. Gross state product per employed person Real GSP per employed person provides a measure of the value added by each worker in the Victorian economy. Real GSP per employed person increased 0.6 per cent in 2008-09 and has increased from $98 000 to $107 000 since 1999-2000 as measured in 2007-08 dollars (see Chart B.8).

Gross state product per hour worked Real GSP per hour worked provides a measure of the value added by each hour that Victorians work. It gives a more accurate picture of Victoria's productivity, as it accounts for the effects of changes in the hours of work among the employed. Chart B.9 illustrates real GSP per hour worked in Victoria and real GDP per hour worked in Australia between 1999-2000 and 2008-09. Victoria recorded real GSP of $63.90 per hour worked in 2008-09, up 2.7 per cent from 2007-08 and up 16.5 per cent from 1999-2000.

Extent and quality of business regulation Efficient and effective regulation is essential to improving the competitiveness of the Victorian economy. Regulation that responds to market failures and provides a significant net benefit to the community continues to be an important objective of the Victorian Government. The Government also recognises that regulation can occasionally be detrimental to the Victorian economy as it can impose unnecessary burdens on businesses, adding to the cost of hiring workers, reducing competitiveness, increasing prices and restricting job growth. These burdens can also distort rational resource allocation and become an impediment to productivity growth. In order to remove these impediments, the Victorian Government introduced the Reducing the Regulatory Burden (RRB) initiative in 2006. The RRB initiative established a target for cutting unnecessary regulatory burden on businesses and not-for-profit organisations of 25 per cent ($256 million) by July 2011. In September 2009, the Treasurer announced a revised burden reduction target of $500 million per annum by July 2012. Projects currently in the pipeline are estimated to deliver savings of $246 million: \u2022 Decrease in the Administrative Burden - $261 million \u2022 Increase in the Administrative Burden - $15 million \u2022 Net Decrease in the Administrative Burden - $246 million A greater share of national business investment will be in Victoria Business investment is central to future productivity growth, as it increases the quantity and quality of resources available to the workforce. For example, investment in machinery and equipment allows for adoption of the latest technologies, and investment in research and development leads to new products and services. This Progress Report uses private business investment and its components to establish progress against this measure. Private business investment and investment in machinery and equipment Despite the global financial crisis leading businesses to reassess their investment intentions, Victorian total private business investment continued to grow in 2008-09. Since 2000-01, total private business investment has grown by $23.3 billion, an increase of 98 per cent. Investment in machinery and equipment continued to grow in 2008-09, increasing by 12.8 per cent. Over the last nine years, investment in machinery and equipment has grown by $9.3 billion, an increase of 74 per cent (see Chart B.10).

Exports have rebounded strongly after decreasing between 2001-02 and 2003-04, reflecting an increase in services exports. Education services are now Victoria's largest export and were worth $5.4 billion in 2008-09, which is more than four times its value in 2001.

THRIVING Growing and linking all of Victoria ECONOMY Population growth underpins economic growth, sustains regional revitalisation and further strengthens the diversity that is the heart of Victoria. Transport and communications infrastructure links people and businesses across Victoria and links the regions to Melbourne and the world. Victoria's total population will reach seven million people by 2030, and regional population growth will increase to 1.25 per cent annually by 2006 Victoria's total population Victoria's total population growth, including regional population growth, is a key medium and long-term progress indicator. Victoria's population grew by 16.4 per cent between September 1999 and September 2009, and by 2.2 per cent over the year to September 2009, to reach 5.4 million people. Regional population growth Population in Regional Victoria, defined as the area outside the Melbourne Statistical Division, has grown by 10.8 per cent between 1999 and 2009, to reach 1.4 million persons. The Victorian Government's target to increase regional population growth to 1.25 per cent annually by 2006 was narrowly missed (at 1.14 per cent), but has remained above 1.25 per cent since 2007 (see Chart B.15) In 2008-09, Victoria's regional population grew by 1.6 per cent, representing the highest rate of growth since 1982.

Chart B.16 shows that this remains unchanged from the number of services recorded in 2007-08.

The proportion of freight transported to and from ports by rail will increase from 10 per cent to 30 per cent by 2010 The State Government remains committed to promoting increased rail freight movements to and from our commercial trading ports. In place of the 30 per cent by 2010 target, the Government has developed more comprehensive freight and ports strategies, including Freight Futures and Port Futures, designed to achieve this broad objective. In particular, the Government is progressing significant work towards the establishment of a Metropolitan Freight Terminal Network (MFTN) to support increased port related container movements by rail within Metropolitan Melbourne. Freight Futures announced work towards establishing a MFTN as a key plank in its strategy for moving increasing volumes of freight by rail between the Port of Melbourne and freight terminals sited in key industrial areas to the north, west and south-east of Melbourne. Movement of containers with origins and destinations within metropolitan Melbourne currently represents 75 per cent of all container movements within Victoria. Encouraging mode shift within this market has the potential to make an important contribution to overall port mode share. Public transport use in Melbourne as a proportion of trips taken by motorised means will increase from 11 per cent in 2002 to 20 per cent by 2020 Chart B.17 shows that in 2008-09, an estimated 14.3 per cent of all personal motorised trips in metropolitan Melbourne were taken on public transport. Between 2007-08 and 2008-09, metropolitan public transport patronage increased by 9 per cent while vehicle kilometres travelled on metropolitan freeways and arterials decreased by 1.1 per cent.

The last VATS survey yielded a mode share for 2001-02 of 10.7 per cent. (b) Following the discontinuation of VATS in 2002, mode share was estimated using a model developed by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE). The major input of this model was an estimate of vehicle kilometres travelled from the ABS Survey of Motor Vehicle Use. There were a number of limitations to the methodology that have affected the accuracy and reliability of the results. The Department of Transport considers the BITRE model unreliable for reporting against this measure, and has not included its data here. (c) The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA 07) replaced the BITRE model to estimate mode share in 2008. VISTA 07 is aimed at providing detailed information about daily travel and activity patterns. VISTA 07 shares a similar methodology to VATS, and reports a more accurate mode share estimate of personal travel than was previously reported by the BITRE model. (d) Mode share estimates for 2002-03 to 2006-07 and for 2008-09 have been extrapolated from VISTA 07 using five day motor vehicle kilometres travelled and seven day public transport passenger trips as a proxy for five day weekday travel. Public transport patronage and services The number of metropolitan public transport services increased by 0.9 per cent in 2008-09, reaching 142 109 services per week (see Chart B.18). Metropolitan public transport patronage rose 9 per cent in the year to 2008-09, reaching 9.45 million passenger trips per week. This represents the highest level of public transport patronage for over four decades.

High quality, accessible health QUALITY HEALTH and community services AND EDUCATION Health greatly influences quality of life. High quality health and community services need to be available to all Victorians when they need them to preserve and restore good health. Better access to hospital, community health, dental, aged care, mental health, disability, alcohol and drug, and children's and family support services, particularly in rural and regional communities, is crucial. The health of Victorians will improve Long-term improvements in the health of Victorians can be measured through average life expectancy and the quality of life during those years. Quality of life is measured by indicators of physical and mental wellbeing as perceived by Victorians. Self-rated health status The Department of Health's Victorian Population Health Survey (VPHS) collects data on the self-rated health status of Victorians, which is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality trends, as well as health care use. The proportion of Victorian adults reporting their health as 'excellent', 'very good' or 'good' has remained stable at more than 80 per cent for both males and females since the question was first included in the survey in 2001 (see Chart B.19). In 2009, there was little difference between urban and rural and regional respondents which is consistent with previous years (see Chart B.20).

The Kessler 10 is a set of 10 questions designed to categorise the level of psychological distress over a four-week period. It cannot be used to determine the prevalence of major mental illnesses (such as psychosis), but like self-rated health status, it is closely correlated with medical diagnoses of anxiety, depression and worry (psychological distress). The proportion of Victorians reporting no or low levels of psychological distress has remained above 80 per cent since 2001. A lower proportion of females report no or low levels of psychological distress than males, and this has remained constant since 2001 (see Chart B.21). A higher proportion of persons living in rural and regional areas report no or low levels of psychological distress, compared to those living in urban areas (see Chart B.22).

In 2008, the Victorian average life expectancy for males was 79.6 years and for females was 83.9 years (see Chart B.23). These are average figures for all Victorians, and do not represent the estimated life expectancy for certain populations within the State. Due to the relatively small size of the Indigenous population, it is not possible to calculate life expectancy for Indigenous Victorians. However it is recognised that Indigenous life expectancy is considerably lower than the Victorian average, and close to the Australian Indigenous average of 67.2 years for males and 72.9 years for females. Victoria has committed to the Council of Australian Governments' targets on closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy within a generation. To this end, Victoria is working with the Commonwealth and all other states and territories to develop datasets and supplementary indicators to use in addition to five year census data. Last year the ABS produced new experimental Indigenous life expectancy estimates, using a different process for calculating life expectancy. The results provide very different results from previous estimates. The average gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy is now estimated to be 11.5 years for males and 9.5 years for females, whereas previous estimates were approximately 17 years difference for both men and women.

The wellbeing of young children will improve Improving the wellbeing of young children can overcome disadvantage and substantially improve their quality of life as adults. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding has a range of positive effects on the survival, development and growth of babies. Breastfeeding also contributes to the health and wellbeing of mothers, including some protection against breast cancer (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2005). The proportion of infants fully breastfed has slightly decreased since 2007-08. Chart B.24 shows that at 3 months, just over half of infants are still breastfed. By six months, this proportion has reduced to less than 40 per cent.

Immunisation offers protection for individual children and also reduces the rate at which these diseases circulate within the broader community. Evidence suggests that a minimum of 90 per cent vaccination coverage is required to interrupt the ongoing transmission of diseases (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2005). Table B.2 sets out three age cohorts and the vaccinations required for full immunisation. Table B.2: Vaccinations required for full immunisation Cohort Age Vaccinations required Cohort 1 Cohort 2 Cohort 3 12 to <15 months 24 to <27 months 60 to <63 months All scheduled doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) and Hepatitis B. All scheduled vaccine doses of DTP, poliomyelitis, HIB, Hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). All scheduled vaccine doses of DTP, poliomyelitis, HIB, Hepatitis B and MMR vaccines. Source: Australian Childhood Immunisation Register Until 2008 the coverage assessment of the oldest cohort (cohort three), was at 72 to <75 months. However it is now measured at 60 to <63 months and this reinforces to immunisation providers that children must be fully immunised by five years of age. Victorian immunisation rates for children have increased steadily since 1999 and in 2007 Victoria was the first state to achieve the target of 90 per cent in all three cohorts. While in 2009 the coverage of children aged 60 to <63 months is lower than that of 72 to <75 months (see Chart B.25), it is expected that this will increase over time as immunisation status is now tied to child care benefits and the maternity immunisation allowance.

Kindergarten attendance Educational and social outcomes are also important when measuring the wellbeing of young children. Participation in kindergarten programs by four year olds in Victoria is used as a proxy measure for these outcomes in this report. Since 1999, participation rates have remained consistently over 90 per cent (see Chart B.26). Participation rates are calculated as the number of four year old children enrolled in their first year of state funded kindergarten as a percentage of estimated four year old population in Victoria.

Waiting times (emergency, elective and dental) will be reduced The Department of Health collects a range of data about the performance of Victoria's public hospital system, including the number of patients in emergency departments and the number of patients waiting for elective surgery that are treated within clinically recommended times. Emergency waiting times Since 2000, 100 per cent of Triage Category 1 emergency patients (those requiring resuscitation) were seen immediately. In 2008-09, 82 per cent of Triage Category 2 emergency patients were seen within ten minutes, above the Victorian Government target of 80 per cent. For Triage Category 3 emergency patients, 72 per cent were seen within 30 minutes, below the Victorian Government target of 75 per cent. However this is an improvement on performance in 2007-08 (see Chart B.27). In 2008-09, growth in emergency activity was experienced most in the more urgent Categories (1, 2 and 3), where there was a 3.3 per cent increase compared to 2007-08.

Elective surgery time to treatment For patients requiring elective surgery over the past ten years, 100 per cent of urgent patients (Triage Category 1) were admitted within 30 days (see Chart B.28). The median time to treat urgent patients was seven days in 2008-09 and this has varied little since 1999-2000. In 2008-09, 73 per cent of semi-urgent (Triage Category 2) patients were admitted within 90 days. Over the past ten years there has been a significant increase in the number of Category 2 patients admitted, from 56 000 in 1999-2000 to 69 700 in 2008-09. The median time to treat these patients in 2008-09 was 50 days, compared to 53 in 2007-08. In 2008-09, the State Government, in addition to funding provided by the Commonwealth Government for Stage One of the Elective Surgery Waiting List Reduction Plan, provided a combined total of $60 million one-off funding to treat 150 758 elective surgery patients.

Timeliness of dental health services The Department of Health collects data on waiting times for dental treatments in the public system. Chart B.29 shows that the average waiting time for denture care treatment decreased from 21 months in June 2007 to 20 months in June 2009. The average waiting time for general dental care treatment also decreased, from 22 months to 20 months. Clients with urgent dental needs (Priority Denture) are assessed within 24 hours.

The VPHS covers satisfaction rates with selected health services, including public hospitals, community health centres, home nursing, kindergartens, and maternal and child health centres. Satisfaction with the surveyed range of Victorian health and community services has remained high since 2001 (see Chart B.30). Table B.3 provides a summary of the 2009 results and shows that over 80 per cent of respondents from urban and rural and regional areas indicated they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services provided in their area.

QUALITY HEALTH High Quality education and training for AND EDUCATION lifelong learning Education is the key to creating a dynamic, successful community and improving the opportunities in life for all Victorians. Victoria must be a place where children get the best possible start to their education and where people of all ages are motivated to keep learning. The proportion of Victorian primary students achieving national minimum standards in literacy and numeracy will be at or above the national average. Developing strong literacy and numeracy skills in primary school is the basis for later achievement in education and training, and for full social and economic participation. The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority administers national literacy and numeracy tests annually to assess the literacy and numeracy standards of Victorian primary school students. In previous years, the State's literacy and numeracy performance was measured and reported against national benchmarks. However, in 2008 a new data set and methodology was established to measure literacy and numeracy standards against national minimum standards. The minimum standard is calculated at a national level by the Ministerial Council on Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs (MCEECDYA). Results for 2009 were released through MCEECDYA in December 2009. The percentage of year 3 and year 5 Victorian students achieving the national literacy and numeracy minimum standards in 2009 was above the national average. In 2009 more than 95 per cent of Victorian year 3 students achieved the national minimum standard in reading, writing and numeracy (see Chart B.31). At year 5, more than 95 per cent of Victorian students achieved the national minimum standard in numeracy and more than 94 per cent achieved the national minimum standard in reading and writing (see Chart B.32).

The proportion of year 3 and year 5 Indigenous primary students in Victoria and the whole of Australia achieving national minimum standards was substantially below that for the respective cohort for all students in reading, writing and numeracy. However, Victorian Indigenous primary students performed well above the national Indigenous average (see Charts B.33 and B.34 below).

By 2010, 90 per cent of young people in Victoria will successfully complete year 12 or its educational equivalent The completion of Year 12 or its equivalent qualification, such as an apprenticeship or traineeship, is a foundation for stable and rewarding employment. This measure uses data from the ABS Survey of Education and Work (SEW) to estimate the number of Victorians aged 20 to 24 that have attained Year 12 or a vocational certificate at the Australian Qualifications Framework Level Two or above. The Year 12 or equivalent attainment rate for 20 to 24 year olds in Victoria decreased from 87.8 per cent in 2008 to 86.8 per cent in 2009. However Chart B.35 shows that attainment rates in Victoria have increased since 1996 and consistently remained above the national rate. Victoria's 2009 attainment rate was above both the 2009 national rate (84.5 per cent) and the rate of all other Australian states. The ABS has noted that the use of a smaller sample for the 2009 SEW has led to reduced statistical accuracy of estimates, including the estimates of the proportion of young people attaining Year 12 or equivalent. The confidence interval for the 2009 Victorian result of 86.8 per cent has nearly doubled to \u00b14.2 percentage points compared to \u00b12.3 in 2008.

Skills Victoria (formerly the Office of Training and Tertiary Education) collects data on the number of 25 to 64 year olds participating in vocational and education programs. Number of students During the period 1999 to 2003, Victorian Education and Training (VET) student numbers among 25 to 64 year olds grew, peaking at almost 307 000 students in 2003. This number declined to just over 264 000 in 2006 but has since grown to almost 287 000 students in 2008 (see Chart B.36). It is likely the decline between 2003 and 2006 was due to a number of factors including the strength of the Victorian labour market, shifting patterns of participation towards courses of longer duration, and a decline in student numbers in the Adult and Community Education sector over this period.

HEALTHY Protecting the environment for ENVIRONMENT future generations The natural environment sustains every aspect of our lives. Victoria must actively conserve and manage it in order to achieve our social and economic goals. The State has magnificent alpine, desert, rainforest, grassland, wetland, marine and coastal environments - all of which are critical for the survival of our precious native plants and animals and must be preserved for future generations to enjoy. The health of Victoria's rivers will improve significantly by 2010. In particular, the Snowy River will be returned to 21 per cent of its original flow by 2011, and 28 per cent over time. Waterway health River health in Victoria is measured using an integrated monitoring tool known as the Index of Stream Condition (ISC). The statewide ISC assessment was conducted in 1999 and 2004 and found that deterioration in stream condition appears to have been controlled, with approximately 21 per cent of major rivers and tributaries in good or excellent condition. The ISC program occurs every six years to assess the long-term effectiveness of the river health rehabilitation programs in Victoria. The next ISC statewide assessment is being undertaken during 2010. Snowy River In 2000, the Victorian, New South Wales and Commonwealth Governments reached a landmark agreement to return water to the Snowy River. This agreement was later formalised in an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) on the Snowy River. Under the Snowy River IGA, the Victorian, NSW and Commonwealth Governments committed to a phased return of flows to the Snowy River. The targets set were to return: 15 per cent of average natural flows by 2009 (142 gigalitres per year); and 21 per cent of average natural flows by 2012 (212 gigalitres per year) Previously, flows in the Snowy River immediately below Jindabyne were 1 per cent of the long term average natural flow. As of June 2009, the total contribution of water entitlement towards the target for the Snowy River was 216 000 megalitres, jointly met by Victoria (74 000 megalitres) and New South Wales (142 000 megalitres). However while Governments have secured the required volume in water entitlements, the ongoing drought conditions have meant that, as with many users in the Murray-Darling Basin, less than the full entitlement was delivered. For the 12 months prior to the year ending January 2010, the total volume recovered under the Snowy Initiative for the Snowy and Murray Rivers was 63 369 megalitres. The Snowy River share of this volume was 42 267 megalitres which has meant an environmental allocation for the Snowy River equivalent to 4 per cent of the long-term annual natural flow. The quality of air and drinking water will improve Air quality In Victoria poor air quality is predominantly caused by pollution from bushfire smoke and raised dust generated from dry conditions. In 2009, the quality of Victoria's air was compromised by the impact of the Victorian bushfires and wind blown dust (see Chart B.38). Maintaining and improving Victoria's air quality in the future will continue to be a challenge due to expected population growth and the impacts of climate change (a drying climate will lead to increased dust, more planned burning and more frequent bushfires). The EPA (Victoria) and the CSIRO are working together to help predict future air quality in Melbourne based on different scenarios for population growth and climate change.

This is a direct indicator of the public health risk associated with drinking water. The standard for drinking water is set out in the Safe Drinking Water Regulations 2005 and requires that at least 98 per cent of drinking water samples collected over any 12 month period in each water sampling locality be free from E. coli . In 2008-09 drinking water supplies complied with the drinking water standard in all but five of the 483 water sampling localities. This represents 99 per cent of all water sampling localities across Victoria. Chart B.39 shows a significant improvement in drinking water since 2004-05, with the proportion of drinking water free from E. coli increasing from 95 per cent to 99 per cent in 2008-09.

This timing is because the underlying rate of change is relatively slow, the cost of acquiring and processing field data and satellite imagery is high, and short term trends in vegetation quality are unreliable due to natural fluctuations. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) 2008 Native Vegetation Net Gain Accounting: First Approximation Report provided the baseline (as at 2005-06) for the net average rate of change in vegetation extent and quality (see Table B.4). These figures indicate the trends on both public and private land using the habitat hectares (ha) metric, which is a combined measure of vegetation quality and extent. Table B.4: Baseline data of the net average annual rate of change in native vegetation extent and quality Average annual rates of change Public land Private land Gains sub-total Losses sub-total Net outcomes 2005-06 +8,760 habitat ha /yr -2,860 habitat ha /yr +5,900 habitat ha /yr +4,560 habitat ha /yr -14,550 habitat ha /yr -9,990 habitat ha /yr Source: DSE Native Vegetation Net Gain Accounting: First Approximation Report (2008) While the next comprehensive native vegetation assessment has not yet occurred, some components of the accounting are recorded annually and can therefore provide an interim guide to native vegetation trends. The remnant vegetation clearing figures shown in Table B.5 broadly indicate that remnant vegetation clearing has increased. While clearing on private land by landholders has actually decreased, this has been outweighed by an increase in clearing associated with major projects, which has mainly been on public land. Offsets are required for native vegetation clearing in Victoria, and these offsets have also increased, in line with the clearing trends. Table B.4 also shows trends in improvements to native vegetation remnants on private land that have resulted from government incentives. These improvements have increased each year since 2005-06.

In November 2009, the development of a monitoring and reporting program against a set of headline indicators was announced in the Securing Our Natural Future: A white paper for land and biodiversity at a time of climate change . One of these headline indicators, the Land Health Index, will allow the reporting of actual changes in land condition more accurately and over relatively short time periods (years rather than decades) by bringing together different measures of the condition of soil and land. Trials of the Index have commenced and the results of a first assessment, to be conducted in early 2010, will be released later during the year. HEALTHY Efficient use of natural resources ENVIRONMENT A better quality of life for Victorians now and in the future relies upon the community's ability to use Victoria's natural resources, such as water, coal, timber and gas, wisely and effectively. Protecting the environment and the long-term health and prosperity of the Victorian community depends on efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. Greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of energy will be reduced Greenhouse gas emissions Victoria's greenhouse gas inventory is compiled on an annual basis by the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Total Victorian greenhouse gas emissions are measured by carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) released into the atmosphere, enabling comparisons of emissions of various greenhouse gases by their global warming potential. During 2008, total greenhouse gas emissions in Victoria were 119.09 megatonnes (Mt) of CO2-e (including Land Use Change and Forestry). The energy industries sub sector is the largest contributor of the total Victorian greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions intensity of the Victorian economy can be determined by relating total emissions to the value of GSP. The emissions intensity of the Victorian economy has declined by 24 per cent between 1999 and 2008. That is, for each dollar of GSP created, less greenhouse gases were emitted across this period (see Chart B.40).

(b) Total emissions excluding Land Use Change and Forestry. (c) Due to changes in methodologies and data inputs, emissions estimates differ from values published in previous GVT Progress Reports. Stationary energy greenhouse gas emissions Stationary energy includes all fuels used in electricity generation and other direct combustion of fossil fuels used in industry such as manufacturing and construction. It does not include energy used for transport or emissions from industrial processes. In 2008, stationary energy contributed to 67 per cent (80.32 Mt) of Victoria's total net greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1999 and 2008, stationary energy emissions increased by 2.5 Mt. The stationary emissions intensity of the Victorian economy has decreased by 24.4 per cent over the same period, from 377 to 285 tonnes per million GSP. That is, for each dollar of GSP created, less greenhouse gases were emitted (see Chart B.41).

More efficient use of water in agriculture Efficiency in the use of water in Victorian agriculture can be measured by examining both the water delivery systems and the on-farm water use. Delivery system efficiency Chart B.42 shows the delivery system per cent efficiency against the gross water supply available. The lower efficiency in 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 can be attributed to the significant reduction in available water during these years. As fixed losses in delivery systems remain constant from year to year, lower percentage efficiency is expected in years when less water is delivered.

(b) Gross water supply may differ from what was previously reported as data has been adjusted to ensure consistency across all reporting years. On-farm water use In 2006-07, the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) conducted a pilot benchmark for on-farm water use efficiency (WUE) which accessed land use data for four irrigation areas across Victoria. These areas included the Central Goulburn Irrigation Area (dairy), the Red Cliffs Irrigation District (horticulture and viticulture), the Macalister Irrigation District (dairy), and the Shepparton Irrigation Area (horticulture). All four areas were assessed against the following two indicators: 1. Efficiency of irrigated dairy and horticultural industries, which measures whether more or less water is applied to a crop than is required for maximum yield; and 2. Irrigation intensity, which measures the amount of water applied to a crop per area of land sowed with that crop. The results of this benchmarking were presented in the 2009 GVT Progress Report. On-farm WUE indicators require collated datasets on water supply and land use at an appropriate scale. While water supply data can be sourced on an annual basis, complementary land use data can only be sourced on a less frequent basis. Last year it was reported that the benchmark data could be reported in three-yearly reports. This year DPI has accessed Victorian Water Register data for the whole of the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District (GMID) and incorporated it into a water use appraisal system. This process will deliver on-farm WUE indicators in the form of water supplied as against crop water requirement (megalitres/megalitres), and application intensity (megalitres/ha) for the GMID. It will also progressively support the delivery of industry based on-farm WUE indicators for all major irrigation regions in the state. The on-farm WUE Benchmark currently being conducted for the GMID will be reported on at a sub-district scale for the 2008-09 irrigation season. Results of this benchmark are due in June 2010 and will provide an additional snap shot in time, from which potential on-farm water use efficiency trends can be drawn. Melbourne's water usage will be reduced by 15 per cent on a per capita basis from the 1990s' average by 2010 A reduction of 15 per cent in water usage on a per capita basis from the 1990s' average requires a permanent reduction from 423 to 360 litres per person per day. In the year ending June 2009, Melburnians consumed an average of 257 litres of water per person per day (includes residential, non-residential and non-revenue water). This is a 39 per cent reduction in consumption on a per capita basis from the 1990s' average (see Chart B.43).

Total waste generated in 2007-08 was 10.29 million tonnes, which is an increase of 0.1 per cent from the previous year (10.28 million tonnes). However, despite the increase in the overall volume of waste generated, the Victorian economy is actually producing less waste per unit of GSP (see Chart B.44).

Safety in communities depends on good communication, excellent policing and emergency services, and effective measures to address the causes of crime. Crime will be reduced by 5 per cent from 2003 to 2008, and Victorians will feel safer Progress towards increased community safety is measured by both reported crime rates and Victorians' sense of personal safety. This report uses a selected set of crime statistics and surveys of people's perceptions of crime to determine progress against this measure. Rates of crime Victoria Police collects a range of statistics on recorded crime that are used to analyse trends (in rates per 100 000 population) for 27 broad offence categories. These statistics indicate that the total reported rate of crime fell by 16.5 per cent from 2003 to 2008, against a targeted reduction of 5 per cent. Over the period 2001 to 2009, the total reported crime rate has fallen by 25.5 per cent. Chart B.46 focuses on trends in recorded rates of specific crimes: assault, sex (non rape), rape, robbery and motor vehicle theft.

Relative to 2006-07, the rate of reported rape in 2008-09 has decreased by 12.5 per cent however there has been an increase of 10.8 per cent over the period 2000-01 to 2008-09. The rate of reported assault (per 100,000 people) has increased by 37 per cent over the period 2000-01 to 2008-09. Of all assaults reported to Victoria Police in 2008-09, 28.7 per cent were street-related, representing a 2.2 per cent increase from 2007-08. In 2008-09, family violence related assaults accounted for 23.6 per cent of all assaults. The Victoria Police Code of Practice for the Investigation of Family Violence was introduced in August 2004 to support victims of family violence. Since the introduction of the Code of Practice, there has been a 16.3 per cent increase in the number of family violence incidents reported to police. The rate of robbery offences decreased from 63.2 per cent in 2007-08 to 62.1 per cent in 2008-09. While the majority of alleged offenders in this category are male (89.6 per cent), the number of male offenders under the age of 18 has decreased by 2.9 per cent. Perceptions of safety People's perceptions of personal safety do not always reflect recorded crime rates, and as such are treated separately in this report. The Department of Justice conducts a Perceptions of Justice Survey to gather information on community perceptions of personal safety and fear of crime. The survey commenced in April 2002 and continued until December 2005. During 2006, the survey was revised and implemented again in October 2006. Due to changes in the survey methodology, any comparisons or analysis of trends between the two surveys should be treated with caution. Chart B.47 shows a summary of results for the calendar years December 2003 to December 2009. It shows that Victorians' feelings of personal safety remained at high levels throughout 2009.

The Perceptions of Justice Survey also reports on the community's level of worry about being a victim of crime from house break-ins, motor vehicle theft, physical assault or robbery, and sexual assault. Victorians' level of worry about being a victim of crime from sexual assault has declined slightly over the last three reporting periods, from 20.5 per cent in 2007 to 17.5 per cent in 2009 (see Chart B.48). The level of worry regarding house break-ins and motor vehicle theft has remained relatively stable, as has concern regarding physical assault or robbery.

Reported crime on the Victorian train network The number of reported incidents of crime against the person (including robbery and assault offences) on the Victorian train network in 2008-09 decreased by 10.5 per cent to 1 248 reported incidents (see Chart B.49). This is despite an increase in metropolitan train patronage of 6.3 per cent in 2008-09.

In 2001, the road toll was 444, compared with 332 in 2007 (see Chart B.51). This represented a 19.4 per cent reduction in fatalities from the three year average of 412 recorded between 1999 and 2001, which was the baseline for the 20 per cent reduction target as set out in arrive alive! Victoria's Road Safety Strategy 2002-2007 . In February 2008 Victoria launched its new road safety strategy, arrive alive 2008-2017. This strategy set a new target to reduce deaths and serious injuries by a further 30 per cent by 2017. In 2009, Victoria recorded its lowest road toll since records began in 1952 with 290 people losing their lives. Victoria recorded 5.34 deaths per 100 000 head of population compared with 7.36 per 100 000 for the rest of Australia. The 2009 road toll represents a decrease of 12.7 per cent from the three year average of 338 fatalities, which is the baseline for the 30 per cent reduction target. Victoria is likely to meet the national target set in the Australian Transport Council's National Road Safety Strategy 2001-2010 of 5.6 deaths per 100 000 head of population by the end of 2010.

Of these, 2 098 occurred in regional Victoria and 5 160 occurred in metropolitan Melbourne. Complete serious injury data for 2009 is not yet available. Since 2006, serious injury data has been sourced from the Traffic Incident System (TIS).

The extent and diversity of participation in community, cultural and recreational organisations will increase Active, confident and resilient communities show greater participation in community activities. The Victorian Population and Health Survey (VPHS) collects information on participation across a range of community organisations and volunteering. Chart B.53 shows levels of community participation and volunteering in Victoria. Higher proportions of rural and regional respondents participate in community events and help out local groups as volunteers.

The VPHS includes the question: 'Can you get help from family/friends/neighbours when you need it?' The proportion of respondents answering 'yes, definitely' or 'sometimes' has remained relatively stable between 2001 and 2009. In 2009: \u2022 91.4 per cent of respondents reported that they could get help from family; \u2022 94.4 per cent of respondents reported that they could get help from friends; and \u2022 72.6 per cent of respondents reported that they could get help from neighbours. While rural and regional respondents reported similar levels of support from family and friends as urban respondents, they were more likely to answer 'yes, definitely' or 'sometimes' when asked if they could get help from neighbours (see Chart B.54).

Opportunities in education, health and housing are not currently distributed evenly throughout the community - and for children and young people lack of opportunity in any of these areas can have serious repercussions throughout life. Disadvantage in health, education and housing among communities will be reduced Progress towards this goal will be seen through improved outcomes for disadvantaged groups and communities in areas such as health, education and housing. Improvement in outcomes for disadvantaged Victorians can be gauged by looking at key risk factors for different groups in our community such as low birth weight, non-completion of year 12 or equivalent, housing stress, and imprisonment rates. Self-rated health status The self-rated health status and the level of psychological distress of Victorians vary according to socio-economic disadvantage. The ABS defines areas of high socio-economic status as locations where the population is the least disadvantaged. Conversely, populations which are most disadvantaged are defined as having low socio-economic status. According to the Victorian Population Health Survey (VPHS), over the period 2001 to 2009, a higher percentage of Victorians living in high socio-economic status areas reported their health status as 'excellent', 'very good' or 'good' compared to Victorians living in areas of low socio-economic status (see Chart B.55). Psychological distress Similarly, a higher proportion of Victorians living in high socio-economic status areas report their level of psychological distress (Kessler 10) as 'no or low risk' compared to low socio-economic status areas. However, the gap between the two groups which widened in 2007 has narrowed again in 2008 and 2009 (see Chart B.55).

No. 2033.2.30.001) Birth weight Low birth weight (less than 2 500g) is an important indicator of health and wellbeing in both infancy and later life. It is a risk factor not only for infant mortality and morbidity, but also for adult development of cardiac disease, diabetes and kidney failure. The Department of Health records the number of low birth weight babies born in Victoria. The proportion of low birth weight babies born to non-Indigenous mothers has varied little since 1999, and was 6.4 per cent in 2008 (see Chart B.56). Because of the small number of Indigenous mothers, the proportion of low birth weight babies varies from year to year but is on average approximately twice the rate to non-Indigenous mothers. In 2008, the total number of babies born to Indigenous mothers was 727. Of these, 109 (or 15 per cent) were born with a low birth weight.

Housing affordability Housing affordability continues to be an issue for Victorians from disadvantaged groups. Low-income households that spend 30 per cent or more of their gross household income on housing costs are commonly defined as experiencing housing stress. Chart B.57 shows that after peaking at 7.1 per cent in 2005-06, the proportion of households experiencing housing stress in 2007-08 (5.1 per cent) has returned to comparable levels experienced from 1999 to 2004.

(c) The Survey of Income and Housing was an annual Survey up until 2003-04 (with the exception of 2001-02). From 2003-04 onwards, the Survey has been conducted biennially. Social housing The provision of affordable social housing plays an important role in the reduction of housing stress. Increasing the total number of social housing properties enables a greater number of people to live in affordable housing. This is measured by the total number of social housing stock provided for low income Victorians. Chart B.58 shows that social housing stock numbers have been steadily rising since 1999.

This is done via a segmented waiting list that prioritises applicants in greatest need. Chart B.59 shows that the proportion of allocations to people in greatest need has remained broadly stable since 2002-03 and reached a high of 72.7 per cent in 2008-09.

The average wait time for public housing allocations to clients in greatest need has been trending upwards over time (see Chart B.60). The significant jump since 2001-02 was due to the removal of the private market rent test from assessment of early housing eligibility. This required applicants to provide proof of inability to afford private market housing. Whilst the Government is committed to provide housing to the most vulnerable Victorians in need, continuing decreased opportunity in the private rental market and lower exit rates of public housing tenancies has resulted in lower turnover. This has put increasing upward pressure on the average wait time and in 2008-09, the average wait time reached 7.1 months.

Availability of services to this group is necessary in reducing disadvantage and increasing opportunity. Provision of these services has been historically provided through the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), which from 1 January 2009 was incorporated into the National Affordable Housing Agreement and is now known as the Homelessness Support Program. Chart B.61 shows that in 2007-08, just over 42 000 clients received homelessness support. From 2007-08, this number also includes clients assisted through the new Social Housing Advocacy Support Program (SHASP).

An appropriate substitute is to use the total number of homeless clients assisted with homelessness support as per the above graph. The number of early school leavers who are unemployed after six months will decline Early school leavers, particularly those from disadvantaged groups, are a difficult cohort to measure. The most suitable data currently available for this progress measure is the survey of school leavers known as On Track. The survey is conducted by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and is an annual telephone survey of young people who left school in years 10 to 12 in the previous year. Early school leavers are defined as students who have left the school system prior to completing year 12. The number of early leavers included in the sample varies from year to year. The sample of early school leavers includes only those young people who could be identified, contacted and consented to participate in the study. Therefore the results should be interpreted with care. The results provide an indication of the proportion who reported that they were not in any form of education or training and were looking for work at the time of the survey. The proportion of early school leavers looking for work increased from 14 per cent in 2008 to 17.9 per cent in 2009 (see Table B.7). This increase reflects the tighter youth labour market following the global financial crisis in late 2008, and mirrors results from the ABS Labour Force Survey for Victorian 15 to 19 year olds conducted in March 2009. This Survey measured the unemployment rate as 18 per cent, compared to 14.8 per cent in 2008.

Chart B.62 shows that in 2009 a higher proportion of young people entered University (45.4 per cent, compared to 44.1 per cent in 2008), and that a lower proportion undertook an apprenticeship or traineeship (8 per cent, compared to 9.9 per cent in 2008). Compared to 2008, a higher proportion of young people were looking for work. This again reflects the tighter youth labour market following the global financial crisis in late 2008.

(b) Students who deferred a tertiary offer have been attributed to their destination at the time of the interview. The prison population will not grow as quickly and reoffending will be reduced When measuring disadvantage, improved outcomes for the Victorian criminal justice system such as reduced imprisonment and reoffending rates are important, as people from disadvantaged backgrounds are over-represented in these figures. Previously Victoria's prison rates were presented in calendar years however since 2005-06, Corrections Victoria has preferred to report daily average numbers over a full financial year wherever possible. Victoria's imprisonment rate increased from 92 prisoners per 100 000 adult population in 2004-05 to 103.6 in 2008-09. Imprisonment rate by gender The average daily prison population for 2008-09 was 4 299. Males make up the overwhelming majority, with an imprisonment rate of 198.7 per 100 000 adult population in 2008-09, compared to the female rate of 12.2 (see Chart B.63). The male prisoner population increased from 3 932 prisoners in 2007-08 to 4 042 prisoners in 2008-09 (an increase of 2.8 per cent), while the female prisoner population increased from 244 prisoners to 257 prisoners respectively (an increase of 5.3 per cent).

Imprisonment of disadvantaged people A point-in-time 'snapshot' of prisoners from the Corrections Victoria prisoner database is used to measure the proportion of prisoners with two or more characteristics of serious disadvantage prior to imprisonment. The characteristics of 'serious disadvantage' include: unemployment; homelessness; Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander descent, or both; drug/alcohol status (abuse, offending or support); and intellectual disability or psychiatric admission. At 17 January 2010, 48.5 per cent of prisoners had two or more characteristics of serious disadvantage. This percentage is down from the January 2009 figure of 50.4 per cent and the January 2008 figure of 54 per cent. Imprisonment of Indigenous people In 2008-09 the Indigenous imprisonment rate remains significantly higher than the overall Victorian imprisonment rate, with Indigenous persons being 12.6 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous persons. As with the non-Indigenous prisoner population, males comprise the vast majority of Indigenous prisoners and account for 93 per cent of the total Indigenous prisoner population. In 2008-09, Victoria recorded a daily average number of 249 Indigenous prisoners. Reoffending The proportion of Victorian prisoners who return to prison under sentence within two years of being released has steadily decreased over recent years. Chart B.64 shows that in 2008-09, 33.9 per cent of prisoners released returned to prison under sentence, compared to 41.8 per cent in 2000-01.

More than 75 per cent of Victorians think that multiculturalism makes life in their area better. Chart B.65 shows that respondents from urban areas consistently report a more positive response than those from rural and regional areas. However, a higher percentage of rural and regional respondents (17.4 per cent compared to 5.6 per cent of urban respondents) selected the 'not applicable' option, indicating that they did not believe the question to be relevant to the area where they lived. Current trends show a small decline overall from 79.9 per cent in 2005 to 75.2 per cent in 2009.

From 2005 onwards, an extra category was added to the survey and this new category enables respondents to answer 'not applicable' if they feel that is the more appropriate response (for example, if multiculturalism is not a feature of their area). VIBRANT Greater public participation and DEMOCRACY more accountable government Open and accountable Government is one of the fundamental commitments the Government made to the people of Victoria. It is the right of all Victorians. More Victorians from all backgrounds will have the opportunity to have a say on issues that matter to them Greater involvement in decision making signifies growing democratic participation. The Victorian Population Health Survey (VPHS) records the proportion of Victorians who feel there are opportunities to have a real say on issues that are important to them. The proportion who feel they have a say remained fairly constant between 2001 and 2009 (see Chart B.66). A higher proportion of females (76.7 per cent) than males (71.5 per cent) responded positively in 2009. There was no difference between rural and regional respondents and urban respondents. The VPHS also collects information about the proportion of Victorians who feel valued by society. The proportion who feel valued by society has remained stable since 2001 and was 83.2 per cent in 2009 (see Chart B.66). Similar levels of males and females report feeling valued by society at 83.5 per cent and 83 per cent respectively. Rural and regional respondents also had similar levels to urban respondents (82.7 per cent and 83.4 per cent respectively).

This is the eighth report to Victorians and is in line with this commitment. VIBRANT Sound financial management DEMOCRACY Victoria's ability to attract people, investment and new jobs, to provide better services, and to protect the environment, depends on a strong and secure financial base. An annual budget surplus of at least $100 million Continued sound financial management can be illustrated by the budget bottom line. The 2010-11 estimated budget surplus (net result from transactions) is $872 million. Victoria's AAA credit rating will be maintained The State's credit rating provides an independent assessment of the State's financial position against international benchmarks. It is an indicator of the Government's financial management performance. The State of Victoria is rated by two international rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service). Both rating agencies conduct an annual review of the State's financial performance and outlook, balance sheet positions, liquidity and debt management strategy, and the fiscal outlook and strategy given the State's economic structure and prospects. Victoria's AAA credit ratings were reaffirmed by Moody's Investors Service in January 2009 and Standard & Poor's in September 2009. Victoria's taxes will remain competitive with the Australian average The competitiveness of Victoria's tax regime plays an important role in underpinning economic growth and investment. Consistent with the Government's strategic priority of promoting growth across the whole of the State, the Government aims to ensure that Victoria's taxes remain competitive with the Australian average. The Government's preferred measure of tax competitiveness is state taxation expressed as a share of Gross State Product (GSP) which relates the level of taxation revenue to economic capacity. In 2008-09, the latest full year for which actual data are available, Victoria's taxation revenue was 4.33 per cent of nominal GSP. This ratio is above the Australian average of 4.04 per cent, and between New South Wales' ratio of 4.44 per cent and Queensland's 3.64 per cent. Another measure of tax competitiveness, which is often cited by some other states, is taxation revenue per head of population. In 2008-09, Victoria's ratio was estimated to be $2 346 per person, which is lower than the per capita tax burden in New South Wales and Western Australia and similar to the Australian average ($2 331)."

(f) This performance measure has been included in the new measure 'Clients assisted with support to address and prevent homelessness' in new output, 'Housing Support and Homelessness Assistance'. (g) This performance measure is no longer relevant since policy and funding agreements require that all clients assisted are in urgent housing need. (h) This performance measure has been included in the new measure 'Total social housing dwellings acquired during the year' in the new output, 'Social Housing'. The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2009-10 Target due to lower than expected performance from the Nation Building and Jobs Plan . The commonwealth government reduced Victoria's allocation by $318 million. (i) This performance measure has been included in the new measure 'Total number of social housing dwellings' in the new output, 'Social Housing'. (j) This performance measure is no longer relevant as home loans now represent a relatively small proportion of the department's operations. The provision of long term finance was ceased in November 1996.

(t) This performance measure has been combined with the 2010-11 performance measure 'Community facility grants: number approved' for better alignment with the Department's priority of facilitating for development of multi-use community facilities, including aquatic facilities.

(w) This performance measure is no longer relevant as works at the Rectangular Pitch Stadium will be delivered in 2009-10. The project will now be the responsibility of the Melbourne and Olympic Parks Trust.

It has been replaced to more accurately report on personnel accredited to serve in a senior fire role, as the former measure was influenced by periods of high recruitment in the lead up to the bushfire season. (d) Due to the success of each of these projects in terms of water savings and behavioural change practices, both the participating water corporations and private industries have identified new skills and techniques to be applied into the future.

(b) The Bus Safety Act 2009 (Vic) will give Public Transport Safety Victoria (PTSV) strengthened compliance and enforcement tools in relation to monitoring bus safety, including improvement notices. PTSV will therefore monitor and report on improvement notices instead of non-compliance reports. (c) This measure has been replaced by the new performance measure 'Taxi and hire vehicle complaints investigated and closed within 45 days', with a higher 2010-11 Target of >85 per cent which reflects a reduction of investigated complaints that remain open. (d) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than the 2009-10 Target due to improvements to complaints assessment and feedback management processes within the Victorian Taxi Directorate. Notes (continued): (e) This output measure is replaced with the new output measure 'Commercial registered training organisations and training providers audited' to reflect the activities to be undertaken in 2010-11'. The audit program for recreational registered training organisations and training providers is undertaken every two years and is next scheduled for 2011-12. (f) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is based on the data from the Victorian Water Police. (g) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is based on the data from the Victorian Water Police, which is a combination of Registration Compliance (97 per cent) and Licence Compliance (95 per cent). (h) This measure has been replaced by the new performance measure which is calculated using a new methodology under the new Franchise Agreements. (i) Results as at 30 November 2009, whereupon the new Franchise Agreement took effect. (j) This measure has been discontinued as the measurement of public transport capital initiatives is captured within the 'Public Transport Infrastructure Development' output. (k) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome represents franchisee capital projects delivered or transitioned to the new metropolitan train and tram franchisees in the period to 30 November 2009. (l) This output measure is replaced with two new outputs measures 'Service punctuality for train services' and 'Service punctuality for tram services' which are based on the new Franchise Agreements. (m) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is higher than Target due to the higher number of approved grants being delivered in the final year of the program. (n) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is later than the 2009-10 Target due to a design change to improve the signalling headway. (o) Early works for construction began in 2008-09. Platform works were completed in quarter 1 of 2009-10. (p) The 2009-10 Expected Outcome is later than the 2009-10 Target due to delays from the supplier submitting design approval documentation. (q) New station building opened in December 2009. (r) These milestones were able to be achieved earlier than forecast due to the use of an alliancing procurement method. (s) These two output measures have been discontinued as the existing measures 'Bridges that are acceptable for legal load vehicles: metropolitan and regional' provide a better measurement of capacity of bridges to safely service legal loads.

                    "text": "This section provides an overview of the local government sector in Victoria and highlights the 2010-11 Budget initiatives that involve councils. Local government is an essential tier of government in Australia, enshrined in the State's Constitution. Victoria has 79 councils providing a wide range of services. Many state government programs are either delivered by, or in conjunction with, local government. State government programs may operate in a specific local government area, with in kind support and in collaboration with local government. Transparent and Accountable Government The State Government is committed to achieving better services for Victorian Communities and ensuring the highest standards of accountability and transparency in local government. In August 2009, the Premier charged the Essential Services Commission with the development of a performance assessment and benchmarking regime for local government. The regime will improve transparency and benchmarking, assisting residents to be informed about local government service delivery performance and facilitating improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of local government service provision. The new regime will be trailed in early 2011 and is expected to be up and running in 2012. Also in September 2009, the Government established the Local Government Inspectorate as an administrative office of the Department of Planning and Community Development. The Inspectorate will investigate alleged breaches of the Local Government Act 1989, and implement a rolling audit program of councillor compliance, including spot audits. The State Government continues to reform legislation to support democratic local elections and improved councillor conduct. A review of the conflict of interest rules that were introduced in 2008 has been completed, and additional legislation will be presented to Parliament in 2010 to further improve electoral representation processes and refine the rules for disclosing conflicts of interest. The Councils Reforming Business (CRB) initiative funded in 2007-08 focused on five key areas of reform: procurement, local laws, shared services, EasyBiz (online forms) and affordable housing. Following the success of the first phase of the CRB program, new funding was provided in 2009-10 to further implement reform. The focus of CRB over 2010-11 will be in the areas of Procurement Strategy implementation, Better Practice Local Laws and Building Site Management and the expansion of the EasyBiz program. Creating Liveable Communities The State continues to support local government through the development and maintenance of community infrastructure and facilities. This includes funding for the Living Libraries program to assist councils in the rejuvenation of library facilities, grants to deliver community hubs, local sporting facilities and heritage protection. Local government is also a key partner in the implementation of Melbourne 2030 , Melbourne @ 5million and state planning initiatives. New planning structures such as the Development Assessment Committees, as well as the Expert Assistance program, enable state and local governments to partner in the planning and development of metropolitan activity centres and regional centres. FUNDING SOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN VICTORIA The Victorian local government sector spends around $5.6 billion a year according to the most current Victorian Grants Commission data. This comprised around 2 per cent of Victoria's gross state product in 2008-09. Councils deliver vital services to their communities, including community services, local roads, waste management, recreation and cultural activities. Around 69 per cent of recurrent local government revenue is obtained from rates and charges levied by councils. Around 9.1 per cent of council recurrent revenue is provided through the Victorian Grants Commission as general revenue assistance and for local roads. Other recurrent Commonwealth and Victorian grants comprise approximately a further 9 per cent of council recurrent revenues. Most State Government funds provided to local governments are used to subsidise libraries, community assets, sporting facilities and other specific services. The State Government also provides land and payroll tax exemptions to local government, which benefit Victorian councils by more than $250 million a year (refer to Tables 5.2 and 5.4 in Budget Paper No. 4). Local government also provides some rate exemptions to the State Government.

(b) Grants to local government have been revised upwards by $420 000 in 2009-10 to reflect estimated grants payable under the Strategic Partnerships Program. (c) Excludes funds provided to local government under the Home and Community Care program as these are for service delivery rather than provided as a grant. (d) Most of these funds are Commonwealth financial assistance and road grants that are passed on to local government (around 80 per cent). As shown in Table D.1, total grants and transfers to local government are expected to increase by approximately 2 per cent, from $659 million in the 2009-10 Budget to $673 million in the 2010-11 Budget . Grants and transfers to local government in 2009-10 are expected to be lower than budgeted, primarily due to adjustments in payments from the Departments of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development, Sustainability and Environment and the Department of Planning and Community Development. The Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD) provides the majority of funds to assist local government. Most of these funds are Commonwealth financial assistance and road grants that are passed on to local government (around 80 per cent). The variance in grants made to local government in 2009-10 by the Department of Planning and Community Development is mainly due to the receipt of 25 per cent of the 2009-10 Commonwealth payment in the fourth quarter of 2008-09. The variance in payments by the Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development to local government in 2009-10 is primarily due to the number of grant submissions lodged and assessments undertaken being lower than expected. In addition, some grants are milestone based and delays in programs have resulted in payments being pushed back. The decrease in grants and payments to local government in 2010-11 is predominantly due to a number of sunsetting programs in 2009-10. Grants made to local government by the Department of Sustainability and Environment are expected to change from the original $16 million allocated in the 2009-10 Budget to a revised $12 million. This variation is mainly due to the phasing of payments to local governments in 2009-10 including the Unbundling Water Rights program, the completion of a number of projects in 2010-11, including the Middle Park Beach Protection program and the transfer of the Local Ports function to the Department of Transport. Bushfires The Department of Treasury and Finance administers the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), which provide financial assistance to councils affected by natural disasters, such as bushfires, floods and severe storms. This funding is largely used to reimburse costs incurred by local councils in emergency protection and asset restoration works, such as the clean up and repair of roads and infrastructure. Actual expenditure fluctuates each year depending on the number and magnitude of natural disasters that have occurred and the funding needs of councils. In recognition of the unprecedented severity of the 2009 Victorian bushfires, in 2009-10 local councils will continue to receive financial assistance for the standard relief and recovery measures under the NDRRA, as well as for other measures approved by the government, such as reimbursement for the waiver of selected fees and charges, including building permit fees. Community Support Fund The Government has committed to two objectives for the Community Support fund: minimising problem gambling-related harm and the prevalence of risk factors that contribute to problem gambling (such as social isolation and disadvantage), and strengthening neighbourhoods and communities, particularly in areas of high need. During 2009-10, local governments received funding from a number of government programs which were funded from the CSF, including Victorian Community Support Grants which are also funded from the CSF. Examples of community infrastructure and planning projects from the 2009-10 financial year include: \u2022 funding of $320 000 to East Gippsland Shire Council as part of a $507 000 project to undertake community planning involving communities across East Gippsland. This initiative will support the future development and resilience of East Gippsland communities and their ability to adapt to changing circumstances; \u2022 funding of $170 000 to Mansfield Shire Council as part of a $277 000 project to strengthen rural communities within the Mansfield Shire. This project will identify and establish township action committees, increase community capacity to lead community planning and action, and enhance communications within and between communities; \u2022 funding of $2.5 million to Whitehorse City Council as part of a $15.1 million project to redevelop the Aqualink facility in Box Hill. This funding will support the upgrade and expansion of the aquatic and Health and Fitness areas of the facility; and \u2022 funding of $1.5 million to Wyndham City Council as part of a $9.8 million project for the new Wyndham Vale Community Learning Centre located in Wyndham's northern growth corridor. This new community centre will offer library and community facilities including kindergarten and maternal and child health rooms. 2010-11 BUDGET INITIATIVES This section outlines the key 2010-11 Budget initiatives by department that will be undertaken in partnership with local government. This section includes initiatives where local government is the recipient of grants and transfers and other initiatives which broadly impact local government. State Government funding details for each of these initiatives are provided in Appendix A of this Budget Paper. Department of Planning and Community Development The Department of Planning and Community Development provides a range of grants to local government for libraries, sporting and community assets and provides support for planning. The Department operates programs across Victoria and provides in kind and collaborative support to these programs. The Department of Planning and Community Development 2010-11 Budget initiatives that affect local government are: \u2022 Building Infrastructure and Growing Communities; \u2022 Living Libraries; \u2022 Better planning for housing and employment growth; \u2022 Expert Assistance Program; \u2022 Investment in community sport and recreation facilities; \u2022 Local Government Inspectorate; \u2022 Local Government reform program - Financial and asset management, collaboration and cooperation; \u2022 Regionally significant sporting grants program; and \u2022 Urban Regeneration of Northern Geelong-Corio-Norlane. Department of Justice The Department of Justice works with local government in a range of ways such as providing funding to local government for volunteer units of the Victoria State Emergency Service, partnering to deliver the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria, and supporting the Department's Victims Assistance and Counselling program. In addition, Victoria Police work with local government on a range of programs, such as the Neighbourhood Justice Centre with the City of Yarra. Consumer Affairs Victoria coordinates the delivery of some of its programs with local government. The Country Fire Authority and local government councils work closely to provide efficient and effective fire prevention and mitigation programs that reflect local needs. The Department of Justice 2010-11 Budget initiatives that affect local government are: \u2022 Bushfire Preparedness - Community Education and Engagement; and \u2022 Bushfire Preparedness - CFA Volunteer Brigades supporting Vegetation Management. Department of Sustainability and Environment Many of the Department of Sustainability and Environment's programs are jointly managed and delivered by local government. In addition, the Department provides a range of materials and information to help assist local government in undertaking its responsibilities, for example, building environmental sustainability through Victoria's Environmental Sustainability Framework. The Department will also work with Local government to deliver elements of the 'Jobs for the future economy'.

                    "text": "In December 2008, the Government released its $38 billion Victorian Transport Plan (VTP) to transform Victoria's transport network. The VTP provides short, medium and long term investments to build a transport system that improves mobility, drives job creation and economic growth, and supports environmentally sustainable transport. The 2010-11 Budget has continued to fund the VTP with an additional total estimated investment (TEI) of $5.7 billion with $108 million in output funding across the forward estimates. In the year and a half since the VTP was released, the Government has now funded a total estimated investment (TEI) of $9.8 billion with $539 million in output funding across the forward estimates. This includes Commonwealth Government funding of approximately $5.1 billion. In addition the Government has funded Peninsula Link which will be delivered as a Partnerships Victoria project.
