                    "text": "The 2012-13 Budget drives economic growth, generates jobs and productivity, focusing on record infrastructure, frontline services and protecting the vulnerable. Victoria faces challenges - a high Australian dollar, weaker global and national economic conditions and a substantial reduction in GST and other revenue. Revenue from GST and stamp duty has fallen by $7.6 billion over four years - or almost $2 billion a year - relative to the levels predicted in late 2010. In the face of these challenges, the Government is taking decisive action to strengthen the State's finances, boost state-funded infrastructure to record levels (with a focus on productivity-enhancing infrastructure) while protecting the most vulnerable. We can only do this by keeping spending growth in check. Over the decade to 2010-11, state government spending grew by an average of 7.3 per cent per annum, outpacing revenue growth of 6.9 per cent. This left the budget exposed to falls in revenue. The 2012-13 Budget constrains spending growth to an average 2.9 per cent over the forward estimates period. Had spending continued at 7.3 per cent growth, the budget would now have a $4 billion deficit in 2012-13 and net debt would have risen to completely unsustainable levels. By keeping recurrent spending growth in check, the 2012-13 Budget delivers surpluses in every year and is able to fund a strong infrastructure spend. There are currently $41 billion worth of projects across the public sector. A strong infrastructure program is necessary to boost Victoria's productivity, the competitiveness of our industries, and to maintain liveability. This budget funds: \u2022 delivery of three major congestion initiatives in metropolitan Melbourne to cut travel times; \u2022 construction of the Dingley Bypass to improve traffic and freight movements in south east Melbourne; \u2022 purchase of new rolling stock for the regional rail network to improve the level of services across regional and rural Victoria; \u2022 major new periodic rail maintenance across the regional passenger and rail freight network; and \u2022 a number of important road upgrades including the Ballarat Western Link Road and the Koo Wee Rup Bypass. These are in addition to the major upgrade of Webb Dock to increase capacity and competition at the Port of Melbourne, and the Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal project which is jointly funded with the Commonwealth. The budget also takes the next step in relation to a number of major transformational projects including the East West Link, Melbourne Metro rail and the Port of Hastings. To further drive economic activity and jobs, the budget keeps taxes competitive and cuts WorkCover premiums for employers. This will maintain Victoria's average workers' compensation premium rate as the lowest in Australia. It also invests heavily in skills and funds a $58 million manufacturing package, a new agriculture and food industry plan and a $50 million international engagement strategy to expand Victoria's export markets. Despite significant financial constraints, the budget includes additional funding to keep pace with demand in our public hospital system. In addition, the budget reflects the Government's focus on protecting the most vulnerable in our community. The budget makes a $336 million investment to assist vulnerable children and families, combining additional family services, maternal and child health funding, extra child protection workers and a less adversarial, more child friendly court process. A strong economy and strong government finances are fundamental to Victoria's ongoing prosperity. Without economic growth and a strong budget, important services and capital investments become unaffordable. For this reason, the 2012-13 Budget focuses squarely on reversing the legacy of excessive spending and project cost blow-outs, and addresses Victoria's current economic and fiscal challenges. Victoria has strong economic prospects in the years ahead. The 2012-13 Budget is a key step in meeting that potential. Kim Wells Treasurer Victoria has significant economic strengths, including a diverse industry base, competitive business environment, skilled workforce and liveable cities and regions. These strengths, together with the Government's economic strategy, positions Victoria to capitalise on the economic opportunities of the future, especially the unprecedented growth in the Asian middle class. However, Victoria faces significant immediate challenges. These include a high Australian dollar, the euro area recession and their impact on consumer and business confidence. Commonwealth policies like the carbon price will also impose new costs on the Victorian economy. Sectors including manufacturing, tourism, agriculture and international education are feeling these challenges acutely. Currently, output and employment growth are subdued, but are forecast to pick up beyond 2012-13. Despite current economic challenges, claims about a 'two-speed economy' are too simplistic. The mining boom has boosted demand for Victoria's knowledge-based industries, such as insurance and professional services. Agricultural prices and production volumes are high, and Victoria still leads Australia in dwelling investment and overall building construction activity."

Over the last decade, Victorian productivity growth has been falling, and became negative over the period 2005-06 to 2009-10. Having exceeded the national average growth rate in the second half of the 1990s, Victoria's productivity performance lagged Australia as a whole over the period 2000-01 to 2009-10. The 2012-13 Budget delivers on the Government's plan by: \u2022 generating stronger surpluses to fund major productivity-enhancing infrastructure; \u2022 cutting WorkCover premiums for Victorian employers by 3 per cent to drive down business costs; \u2022 delivering a $58 million manufacturing strategy focused on lifting individual firm productivity and investing in technological innovation; \u2022 funding a new international engagement strategy to expand Victoria's export markets, particularly in rapidly growing Asian economies; \u2022 investing in programs to boost agricultural industries, focusing on productivity and biosecurity; and \u2022 driving large investment and reform of the skills sector to boost apprenticeships and encourage students into high productivity, skill-shortage qualifications. A strong budget is fundamental to these efforts. Without a strong budget position, these vital investments - in infrastructure, skills and key industries - would be unaffordable."

Creating significantly stronger budget capacity Strengthening the State's finances is vital to fund a substantial program of high quality infrastructure and deliver better quality frontline services without accumulating unsustainable levels of public debt and safeguarding against future adverse financial shocks. Improving productivity Productivity growth is the long-run determinant of economic prosperity and improved living standards. The Government's reform agenda promotes sustained productivity improvements through a more competitive business environment, more highly skilled workforce, and better delivery of infrastructure. Growing export markets International engagement is increasingly important and will enable Victorian businesses to capitalise on emerging global opportunities. The Government's economic strategy includes increasing trade engagement and expansion into new markets to create jobs and investment. Supporting industries and employees in transition Structural change is inevitable in Victoria's open and dynamic economy. The Government's role is to create an environment for existing and emerging businesses and industries to take advantage of opportunities provided by structural change. The Government will provide assistance geared towards helping companies and workers transition and adjust in response to changes in consumer demands and industry structures.

Weak national consumption and a fall in Victoria's share of GST have meant that total GST revenue to Victoria has been downgraded by $6.1 billion over the four-year budget period, relative to when the Government came to office. Revenue from property stamp duty has fallen by $1.5 billion over the same period. This means that revenue has been reduced by $7.6 billion over four years - or almost $2 billion annually - from these two sources alone. This is a larger revenue write-down than occurred during the global financial crisis of 2008. In addition, from 2008, the Commonwealth's stimulus package added significant revenue to Victoria. By contrast, the current revenue impacts are compounded by expiring stimulus programs and a lack of Commonwealth commitment to the renewal of expiring National Partnership payments."

Over the decade to 2010-11, average annual expenditure growth (of 7.3 per cent per annum) outstripped annual revenue growth (6.9 per cent per annum). Debt was rising and the operating surplus was artificially boosted by temporary stimulus payments from the Commonwealth. If spending were to keep growing as it did over the past decade, this year's budget would be in deficit by $4 billion. In response, the Government has constrained expenditure growth to an average of 2.9 per cent each year from 2013-14 to 2015-16. The Government's restraint is driven by a further round of savings. Since late 2010, the Government has put in place almost $9 billion in measures to support a more sustainable budget position. These measures will deliver projected operating surpluses of $155 million in 2012-13 rising to $2.5 billion by 2015-16."

The Government is committed to a medium-term infrastructure investment parameter of 1.3 per cent of GSP (calculated as a rolling five-year average). The 2012-13 Budget progresses a number of major projects which have the potential to transform Victoria's transport and freight network, including: \u2022 $15 million to deliver the business case for the East West Link. The Government will immediately commence engineering surveys and preliminary geotechnical drilling to inform development of the business case. The business case will consider funding options, including private sector involvement, and the Government will continue to seek a significant Commonwealth contribution to the project; \u2022 $49.7 million to progress the planning and development of the Melbourne Metro rail project; and \u2022 $4 million for the Port of Hastings Development Authority to commence preparations for the expansion of the Port of Hastings to handle international container trade within 10 to 15 years. In addition, the Government is continuing to progress a number of feasibility studies commenced in last year's budget. These include the Doncaster rail study, the feasibility study for the Rowville rail link and the airport rail link study. All of these major projects form part of Victoria's submission to Infrastructure Australia, and the Government will continue to seek Commonwealth contributions to reflect the macroeconomic significance of these potentially transformational investments.

Despite fiscal challenges, the budget keeps Victoria's business taxes competitive, and cuts Workcover premiums for employers. The budget funds new programs for small business including $9 million for Building Innovative Small Manufacturers and continued funding for Business Victoria Online and SuccessMap for Small Business, which help small businesses become more resilient, competitive and productive. The Government will continue to reduce red tape and regulation, as well as oppose national measures such as the carbon price which increase costs for Victorian small businesses. The Government will continue to push back against any move to nationally harmonise occupational health and safety laws which penalise Victorian small businesses. Victoria's future economic growth will be underpinned by a better educated and skilled workforce, increasing productivity and workforce participation. The State has the most employer-responsive and market-driven training system in Australia, with expenditure on training subsidies up by 50 per cent over the past four years, and enrolments growing strongly. A strong and sustainable vocational education and training (VET) system is vital for Victoria's future. The Government is driving a more dynamic, innovative training system, with better quality oversight and stronger targeting of investment to tackle skills shortages and fuel economic growth. The 2012-13 Budget invests a further $1 billion in the skills sector. The Government is ensuring that funding returns to a sustainable level and is targeted to areas of greatest public benefit and future jobs growth. The hourly funding rate provided to many courses that offer the largest benefits to Victoria will increase, both for Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and private providers. Subsidy rates will rise for Certificate III and IV courses in areas like carpentry, bricklaying, engineering, plumbing, aged care, children's services and disability services. Funding rates for a number of other courses will fall, reflecting the need to achieve more sustainable outcomes in response to significant demand growth. All apprenticeship courses will see an increase in hourly rate funding. TAFE funding rates will be brought in line with private sector providers, boosting competition and choice. The Government will work with TAFEs to develop new business models and leverage their established strengths in a more competitive training market. New models of industry engagement are being implemented to ensure that VET is driven by and responsive to industry needs. This will include better information for employers about training providers. In addition, the Government is: \u2022 strengthening pathways into training with an expanded entitlement to allow Victorians of any age whose highest qualification is a Victorian Certificate of Education or Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning, to access a training place at Certificate II and above, and the continuation of funding for pre-accredited training through the Learn Local provider network; \u2022 protecting students by requiring providers to disclose prices upfront and establishing the new market monitoring unit to review prices; and \u2022 working with providers to make sure VET FEE-HELP loans are available to reduce upfront costs for students. The Government will continue to provide additional assistance for Indigenous students, regional students, vulnerable young people and people on low incomes to access training. These reforms will ensure enrolment growth is financially sustainable and government subsidies better target productivity-enhancing training."

Fairer funding for non-government schools was delivered to support the choices of families and the sacrifices parents make. The Government has built on these investments with a reform plan to devolve more decision making to principals and school communities rather than head office. A key component of this agenda is an effort to boost teacher quality through school-level performance management recognition and reward for excellence and flexibility in employment arrangements. In addition to funding provided under the Protecting Victoria's Vulnerable Children package, $30 million over three years will: \u2022 strengthen languages education through teaching scholarships and start up grants for schools; and \u2022 increase funding to support students with disabilities, including for the students with a disability transport program.

Reforms to the child protection system aim to prevent child abuse, reduce its impact on children and deliver the best possible outcomes for children in the care of the State. A comprehensive strategy - Victoria's Vulnerable Children: Our Shared Responsibility - is being developed in response to the findings of the Protecting Victoria's Vulnerable Children Inquiry. This strategy will be released in 2013. It will be a comprehensive step forward for improvements to Victorian child protection services, from prevention and diversion, to early intervention, the courts, care, support and the transition to independence. A newly released Directions Paper outlines the Government's planned year one reforms and activities that will form part of this strategy, including a range of new initiatives being specifically funded in the 2012-13 Budget. The Government's additional investment of $336 million over five years together with a comprehensive range of other reforms outlined in the Directions Paper, will improve frontline services in the education, health, human services, and justice sectors, focusing on prevention, early intervention and response."

The Stronger Families program (formerly known as Family Coaching) will continue to provide additional intensive support to families who have come to the attention of the child protection system and whose children are at imminent risk of being placed in out-of-home care. The Government will also expand this program into two additional sites. Reforms to student support services will include devolving funding to principals in government school clusters to allow services to be provided where they are most needed, and responding more quickly to the most vulnerable students. The Government investment will also improve outcomes for victims of sexual abuse.

Trials of this model have demonstrated key benefits for young people involved including significant improvements in school success, social skills, and reducing anti-social behaviour and substance abuse.

In addition, $59.6 million over four years will support the Victorian Cancer Agency, including its work to translate cancer research into treatments for patients. The budget continues high expenditure on education and skills, in recognition of their vital importance to Victorian youth. Significant additional spending of $1 billion over four years has been allocated to refocus the vocational education and training sector to meet the strong demand for training. Together with ongoing reform in this sector, this investment will support further growth in enrolments and a more responsive sector for students. The Government is also committed to ensuring that schools meet the needs of each family. As well as strengthening local decision-making in government schools, the Government is creating an ongoing 25 per cent link between government and non-government school funding so that families are treated fairly regardless of their school choice. So children can attend schools close to home, the Government is committing $200 million to building and modernising schools including in our fastest growing communities. A $63 million over four years investment for Victoria's maternal and child health services will ensure that Victorians continue to receive high levels of support into the future. This year's budget also protects the most vulnerable, responding to growing demand in child protection services and boosting support for all vulnerable children and their families. The Government is $336 million over five years for immediate frontline initiatives to focus on prevention and early intervention. This will complement a comprehensive future strategy that responds to the Protecting Victoria's Vulnerable Children Inquiry. Additionally, the Government is preparing for the introduction of a National Disability Insurance Scheme to improve support to Victorians with a disability, as well as their families and carers. The Government will continue to support low-income families that are most vulnerable to cost-of-living pressures. This year's budget provides additional concessions funding for energy, water and municipal rates. Families have a fundamental right to feel safe. Central to this is the Government's commitment to deliver the largest increase in police numbers during a single term of government in the State's history. The budget also provides significant additional investment to assist police and emergency services with much-needed infrastructure. The Government is also continuing to strengthen the justice system, through investments in new prison capacity, reforms abolishing suspended sentences for all serious crimes and tougher punishments to send the message that crime will not be tolerated."

It is important to understand and acknowledge the very significant contribution which rural and regional Victoria is making to Victoria's economic performance, particularly through strong agricultural exports. Victoria's food and fibre exports were worth $8.1 billion in 2010-11, accounting for a quarter of the State's exports. Victoria is responsible for 86 per cent of Australia's dairy exports. The Government's vision is for regional communities which are driven by thriving and resilient local industries, strong local networks and served by high quality services and infrastructure. The centrepiece of this strategy is the Government's $1 billion Regional Growth Fund announced in the 2011-12 Budget . This fund is investing in better infrastructure, services and facilities through programs like the Local Government Infrastructure Program. This program provides councils with certainty to plan for and build new infrastructure or renew assets. allocated to 40 local councils to maintain roads and bridges. The Government is also delivering the Regional Rail Link project, which will provide improved rail services from Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo into Melbourne. The 2012-13 Budget funds the purchase of additional rolling stock to increase the capacity of the regional rail network. In addition, $171.9 million is committed to regional rail maintenance for both passenger and freight infrastructure. The mode shift incentive scheme is being continued to encourage more freight onto rail and off the road network. The 2012-13 Budget delivers significant new economic infrastructure including road upgrades and the Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Program, funded with the Commonwealth. In addition to economic infrastructure the Government is committed to investing in important social infrastructure to improve the liveability of Victoria's regions. The Government is progressing the procurement of the new Bendigo Hospital which will be a major new health asset for central Victoria over the decades to come. This budget is committing $199 million towards redeveloping rural and regional hospitals. In the 2012-13 Budget , further school, hospital, and aged care upgrades are being delivered across rural and regional Victoria. Community safety will be improved through police station upgrades to accommodate the additional 1 700 police across Victoria, and a new police and SES station at Waurn Ponds. The budget also upgrades CFA stations and equipment, and funds further planned burning to reduce the risk of bushfires. In addition, a further $160 million was"

As a result, Victoria relies on the Commonwealth for almost half of its revenue. These financial transfers come in two broad forms - tied (Specific Purpose Payments and National Partnership Payments) and untied (GST revenue). Victoria supports a federation that recognises states as the primary service providers, and balances competition and cooperation across governments to promote innovation and sharing of best practice. The system of federal financial relations should support these objectives by minimising the conditions attached to tied funding and ensuring the distribution of the GST does not punish efficient states like Victoria. Since Federation, Victoria has been the only state to have received less than its population share of Commonwealth transfers each and every year to support financially weaker states - the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE). Victoria recognises that these states need to be supported, but Victorians have been paying over and above their share for too long. In recent years, HFE has involved more redistribution to a smaller share of the population, despite the growing fiscal maturity of the Federation. The Commonwealth's comprehensive review of the system used to allocate the GST revenue between the states is a critical opportunity to redress the inefficiencies in the current system. On 23 April 2012 the Commonwealth Government released the interim report of the GST Distribution Review. The interim report identifies some positive areas for investigation and establishes a useful base for further discussion. Victoria is seeking a distribution of GST that ensures every Australian gets an equal share of the GST and the Commonwealth plays its role in taking targeted action to address entrenched disadvantage in some states and territories. The Victorian Government strongly opposes any proposal to use the GST distribution to influence state policy and service delivery. Converting any part of the GST to any form of tied revenue would impinge on states' autonomy, and severely reduce their capacity to undertake reforms, plan future investment and respond to changing conditions and local priorities."

Strong government finances are a major pillar of the Government's economic reform agenda. Since coming to office, the Government has implemented savings rising to $2 billion annually by 2015-16. These measures seek to protect and strengthen frontline service delivery whilst moderating growth in the size of government and reducing its share of the economy to levels more consistent with the long-term average. The Government will continue to develop options for reform of services by: \u2022 streamlining non-departmental entities to improve their governance and the services they deliver to Victorians; \u2022 removing barriers to decision-making and efficient operations by service providers, and helping them to account for delivery to Victorians of the services they use most often, such as transport, schools and hospitals; \u2022 wider adoption of best practice in all parts of service delivery, including increasing the use of open tenders for the delivery of results, well-defined services, and greater use of price signals and other market approaches; and \u2022 reducing duplication with Commonwealth responsibilities. The Government's Better Services Implementation Taskforce, comprising experienced executives from the public and private sectors, will oversee a range of improvements to give Victorians better services, without extra strain on taxpayers. Reforms will ensure that the Victorian public service is positioned to provide quality services into the future. In turn this will provide capacity for the Government to invest in infrastructure to support Victoria's growth.
