It also sets out the costs of the services that are delivered for Victorians and how these services contribute to the achievement of Government's objectives, including a breakdown of all 2012-13 output funding with associated performance targets. An appendix provides an overview of state financial relations with the local government sector. This budget demonstrates significant progress against election commitments and further advances the Government's priorities of improving productivity, protecting the most vulnerable in our community, responding to increased demand for key services and reforming service delivery. The Government is committed to ensuring that resources are focused on core services and that the State's finances remain strong. Achieving this has required the re-direction of funding away from areas of lower priority and towards areas of higher priority."

To ensure that only genuine grants of Crown land remain exempt from duty, the duty exemption will be removed from the Duties Act 2000 . The removal of the duty exemption will bring duty treatment of large commercially oriented leasing arrangements (that are not considered genuine Crown grants) into line with other similar commercial transactions. It is important that such transactions are made subject to the same taxation conditions faced by similar commercial arrangements for competitive neutrality and cost transparency. Duty exemptions that address particular public interest concerns, such as duty exemptions for charitable and public benevolent purposes or where there is no change to the underlying beneficial ownership of property, will not be affected by this initiative."

As described in Chapter 1 of Budget Paper No. 2 Strategy and Outlook , the Government is committed to the sustainable delivery of high quality services over time. One of the many actions undertaken to enhance service delivery performance is the strengthening of output structures, performance measures and departmental objectives. The Government is implementing a number of reforms to enhance performance reporting informed by the recommendations of the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee's (PAEC) 102 nd Report on the 2011-12 Budget Estimates and the Victorian Auditor-General. Driving improvements in performance reporting supports clear and transparent accountability for service delivery and improved operations. In 2012-13, departments have increased clarity of performance measures and output descriptions and reviewed performance targets. These reforms will enable greater scrutiny of service delivery and performance which will help to improve services for the Victorian community. Changes to performance statements in 2012-13 reflect a focus on: \u2022 refining departmental objectives; \u2022 clearly linking objectives and outputs; \u2022 improving the quality of output descriptions; \u2022 renaming, editing, replacing and improving performance measures; and \u2022 enhancing explanations for changes to performance measures and targets. Table 2.1 shows that across government, the reforms have resulted in a net reduction of 12 outputs in 2012-13, bringing the total number of outputs to 127, from 139 in 2011-12. This mainly reflects changes made by the Department of Business and Innovation, Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and Department of Transport to output structures to achieve better alignment between service delivery and objectives. Across government, over 300 performance measures have been either introduced, renamed or replaced to better measure outputs."

The health and hospital system continues to be under pressure from population growth, an ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic disease, and the escalating costs of health care technology. In this context, the Department, in conjunction with service delivery partners, aims to: improve health service performance; reform mental health and drug and alcohol services to better meet client needs; strengthen prevention and health promotion; develop our health service system and organisation; respond to an ageing population; and enable optimal health outcomes. In 2012-13 these objectives will inform the Department's work in implementing the Government's commitment to creating a transparent and accountable approach to health service delivery in Victoria; improved health service performance; and system capacity within a tight fiscal environment."

Measures can be discontinued because a program has ceased, milestones have been met or improved measures have been identified. Measures may change substantially due to a shift in focus of the service, development of improved measures or new data sets which can collect different information. As described in Chapter 2, there has been an increased effort within government to improve output structures and performance measures over the last year to improve the way public services are planned, governed, commissioned and delivered. This has resulted in a larger than usual number of measures appearing in this Appendix this year. Each performance measure included here is accompanied by an explanatory footnote providing reasons for its discontinuation or change. To strengthen accountability and transparency associated with output performance management, the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee (PAEC) has again been invited to review these performance measures to ensure that those measures that are substantially changed or proposed to be discontinued receive a high level of scrutiny. Any amendments to performance measures listed in this appendix will be presented on the Government's budget website www.budget.vic.gov.au and changes will take effect from 2012-13. In the event that a measure listed in this Appendix is continued, where possible a 2012-13 target has been identified to ensure continuity of reporting and transparency in the publication of performance information."

This partnership is enhanced by opening up better communication channels between the two levels of government and establishing greater clarity regarding their respective roles. This in turn facilitates the delivery of services to local communities in a more coordinated and consultative manner. In 2011, a Ministerial Mayors Advisory Panel was established to provide a direct link between the Minister for Local Government and mayors. This advisory panel enables high level advice to be provided on the impact of State Government decisions and legislation. This is in addition to an annual local government ministerial forum involving all mayors and chief executive officers which provides a mechanism for consultation and sharing of ideas on key issues impacting on the local government sector. The continuing development of these consultation mechanisms will be key to improving cooperation between the State Government and local councils in the coming years. Consultation with the local government sector will also begin this year around the Victorian State-Local Government Agreement , facilitating discussion around effective mechanisms for consultation on the responsibilities of the different levels of government. Four projects funded by the Local Government Reform Fund are providing direct support to regional groupings of local governments. The projects include Value Adding through Internal Audit, Building Best Value Capacity and Procurement in Practice and a research project on the impact of councils' asset management requirements on their overall financial viability is in development. These efforts continue the partnership approach between the State Government and the local government sector to build capacity and capability. Work to facilitate better outcomes for local government and the building sector through improvements to local laws remains an ongoing priority. The Living Libraries Infrastructure program is designed to improve Victorian public library infrastructure and to meet the changing needs of communities. All Victorian councils and Regional Library Corporations are eligible for a grant of up to $750 000 from the program to support their local libraries. Local councils continue to face challenges in managing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, drains and community buildings. A number of programs have been established to address this issue. They include the Regional Growth Fund which includes a $100 million Local Government Infrastructure program to support a range of council initiatives and community assets. In 2011-12 $25 million was allocated from this fund to local councils. Forty rural councils have also sought a share of $160 million of funding from the Country Roads and Bridges initiative to ensure regional roads and bridges are renewed and maintained. In 2011-12 $40 million from this fund was allocated to local councils. Local Government Victoria will also continue to work with councils on areas of environmental sustainability improvements. The Government introduced legislation in 2011 to support local government elections. Legislation was passed in 2011 to bring forward the date of council elections from November to October to allow incoming councillors to better meet the budgeting and corporate planning timetable. Legislation was also passed in 2012 to give the voters of the Greater Geelong City Council the opportunity to directly elect their Mayor for a four year term. The Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission's (VCEC) report into streamlining local government regulation identified opportunities to strengthen economic, financial and resource management at the local government level. The Government is committed to supporting councils through a continuous improvement approach. The Government is also considering other reform opportunities identified by VCEC, including better practices in building site managements and enhanced state-local government consultation. The Government will cut red tape, undertake careful analysis and consultation and evaluate the impact of regulations to reduce the regulatory burden on local government and business."

In 2010-11 approximately 69 per cent of local government recurrent revenue was obtained from rates and charges levied by councils. Around 7 per cent of council recurrent revenue was provided by the Victoria Grants Commission as financial assistance grants which include general purpose grants and local roads grants. Other Commonwealth and Victorian grants comprised a further 8 per cent of ongoing revenue. The remaining 16 per cent of ongoing revenue comes from Maternal Child Health and Home and Community Care program payments as well as revenues from interest on bank deposits and rental income from assets owned by local government.

(b) Excludes funds provided to local government from the Home and Community Care program as this is for service delivery rather than provided as a grant. As shown in Table B.1, grants and transfers to local governments are expected to increase from $973.2 million in the original 2011-12 Budget to $975.8 million in the 2012-13 Budget . The Department of Planning and Community Development provides the majority of funds to assist local government. Around 74 per cent are Commonwealth financial assistance grants, including road and general purpose grants that are passed on to local government. Grants made to local government by the Department of Planning and Community Development varied from the original $654.5 million in the 2011-12 Budget to a revised $557.1 million. This variance is mainly due to the Commonwealth bringing forward payments for 2011-12 to June 2011 (2010-11 financial year). Grants and transfers are expected to increase to $687.5 million in the 2012-13 Budget due to an adjustment in Commonwealth financial assistance. Grants made to local government by the Department of Business and Innovation increased from the original $1.5 million in the 2011-12 Budget to a revised estimate of $6.4 million. This variation is due to an increase in grants to local government funded through the Regional Aviation Fund. Grants and transfers are expected to decrease to under $4.0 million in the 2012-13 Budget and will primarily consist of grants to local governments as part of the VictoriaWorks for Indigenous Jobseekers program and Regional Blueprint initiatives. Grants made to local government by the Department of Human Services increased from the original 2011-12 Budget to a revised estimate of $3.8 million due to the machinery of government transfer of the Office for Youth and community programs from the Department of Planning and Community Development. Grants made to local government by the Department of Justice are expected to decrease from $11.7 million in the 2011-12 Budget to $8.2 million in the 2012-13 Budget, mainly due to the completion of funding for projects related to the development of bushfire shelter options, partly offset by funding for community bushfire refuges. Grants made to local government by the Department of Sustainability and Environment increased from the original $6.9 million in the 2011-12 Budget to a revised estimate of $17.6 million. This variation reflects an increase in support for local governments in flood-affected, regional areas to re-establish or replace community infrastructure assets that were damaged by the floods. Grants made to local government by the Department of Transport are expected to increase from $62.4 million in the 2011-12 Budget to $72.4 million in the 2012-13 Budget, mainly due to funds carried over from previous years. Grants made to local government by the Department of Treasury and Finance have decreased from $218.9 million in the 2011-12 Budget to a revised estimate of $134.0 million, and are expected to increase to $175.9 million in the 2012-13 Budget . The variations are primarily due to rephasing of grants to local councils associated with the repair to road and bridge infrastructure for the 2010-11 floods, under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements."

These funds are in addition to those specified in Table B.1 (grants and transfers to local government), noting that funding to local government can not always be estimated until grant programs are complete. During 2011-12, local governments received funding from a number of government programs which were funded from the CSF. This included the Victorian Community Support Grants and Community Facility Funding Program which are administered by the Department of Planning and Community Development and provide a variety of grants towards community infrastructure and community and sporting participation activities. Some examples of funded projects delivered by local government include: \u2022 funding of $230 000 to Ballarat City Council as part of a $630 000 project to develop the Ballarat South Community Learning Facility. The development will provide learning studios and a range of community spaces enabling residents to undertake a diverse range of educational, cultural and social activities; \u2022 funding of $700 000 to Melton Shire Council as part of a $1 million project to establish the Taylors Hill Youth and Community Centre. The Centre will provide a key piece of community infrastructure focusing on activities and programs to strengthen social inclusion, skill development and participation for families and young people; \u2022 funding of $50 000 to Moreland City Council as part of a $80 000 project to relocate the Sussex Neighbourhood House to a new multi-purpose community facility. The new development will create a shared community facility to service a growing participation in the social, learning, recreational and cultural needs of its community; and \u2022 funding of $1 million to Greater Dandenong City Council as part of a $20.8 million project for the second and final stage of the Noble Park Aquatic Centre. The upgrade converted the seasonal but iconic outdoor pool facility into a vibrant multi-purpose year-round community facility. The new facility is of particular benefit to traditionally disadvantaged groups including people with disabilities, older adults, culturally and linguistically diverse groups, youth and school aged children."

Actual expenditure fluctuates each year depending on the number and magnitude of natural disasters that have occurred and the funding needs of councils. In recognition of the unprecedented severity of the 2010-11 Victorian and the February/March 2012 flood events, in 2012-13 local councils will continue to receive financial assistance for the standard relief and recovery measures under the NDRRA. 2012-13 BUDGET"
