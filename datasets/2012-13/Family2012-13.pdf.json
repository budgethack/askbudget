From the outset, this Government has placed the concerns and needs of families at the heart of what we do. Over the last year, the Government has been listening to Victorians about what is important to them. The aspirations people have for their families are powerful. They share a vision in which all Victorians enjoy a high standard of living and are part of safe, secure communities. Victorian families rightfully have high expectations of government. They expect it to focus its efforts and resources on quality, responsive frontline services. At the same time, families expect these services to be provided effectively and efficiently: the Government must live within its means, be mindful of the cost of living and minimise the burden on future generations. A strong, productive economy is fundamental to the wellbeing of our families and children. It will help generate jobs and investment and provide the economic security that allows families to contribute to their wider community and plan confidently for the future. It is only by getting these fundamentals right that the Government can provide the services that Victorians need and expect. Victorians can rightly be proud of our State's highly-skilled workforce, competitive business environment, diverse economy and liveable cities and regions. These strengths augur well for our State's economic future and position Victoria to benefit from global economic opportunities. In the short-term, however, our economy faces challenges. These are caused by global and national macroeconomic factors resulting in a high Australian dollar, a large one-off shift in investment patterns and a fall in consumer and business confidence. These forces are placing real pressure on Victorian employment, small business and industry. For the State, these challenges are made more difficult to address by past unsustainable spending and substantially reduced Commonwealth revenues. This Government is addressing these challenges through a budget that is: financially responsible; provides economic confidence; and secures our State's future prosperity while responding realistically to a tough economic environment. Despite these challenging economic times, the 2012-13 Budget prioritises frontline services. The Government has worked hard to maintain critical health services. It continues significant expenditure on education and skills, as well as measures that protect the most vulnerable in our society. The budget also invests substantially in infrastructure to boost jobs and investment. The Government is listening to Victorian families. By focusing on better-quality and more responsive services, competitive taxation and new infrastructure, this budget supports Victorian families to reach their potential, even during challenging times. Ted Baillieu Premier"

                    "text": "A strong and vibrant economy is fundamental to the wellbeing of our families and children. Victoria has a diverse and flexible economy that is founded on the State's strengths. Melbourne's large pool of skilled labour and world-class liveability make Victoria an attractive location for knowledge-based industries. Victoria is Australia's leading knowledge state, as well as an internationally recognised centre of excellence in medical research and the biosciences. At the same time, Victoria leads the nation in agriculture, with food and fibre exports growing by 19 per cent last year. Its regional centres offer an attractive and affordable lifestyle, often within close proximity to Melbourne. These are the some of the key economic sectors that are in growing demand by Asia's emerging middle classes as our region continues to develop: a trend which will last long beyond the current phase of the mining boom. Victorians can be optimistic about our State having a prosperous and productive economy into the future, if we address the challenges of today to secure our State's future prosperity. Nonetheless, in the short-term our economy faces challenges. Declining global and national economic conditions, the high Australian dollar and their impact on consumer and business confidence are placing pressure on households, small business and industry. Trade-exposed sectors and regions are particularly affected. These pressures are being exacerbated by national policies, including the carbon tax, that increase the cost of living for households and increase business costs. This reduces the competitiveness of sectors such as manufacturing and small business, both of which are heavily exposed to price and export competition. The State faces additional challenges. These include declining goods and services tax (GST) revenue, a weaker State tax outlook and other pressures on our Commonwealth funding. Unsustainably high State Government expenditure growth, which consistently exceeded revenue growth in the decade until 2010, and multiple, serious project overruns have further impacted the State's finances and - unless addressed - will burden Victorian families and future generations of Victorians. The Government is continuing to address these challenges in the 2012-13 Budget , which refocuses public resources on core service delivery responsibilities. These actions are necessary to repair the State's finances and ensure a productive economy that generates jobs and investment. Stronger finances will enable the Government to invest additional amounts in much-needed infrastructure, keep taxes competitive and keep costs of living as low as possible. Only by getting the economic fundamentals right and living within its means can the Government provide better services for all Victorian families, both now and in the future."

Despite the challenging economic environment, the 2012-13 Budget includes a significant spend on health to maintain our health services, as well as continued significant expenditure on education and skills. Additionally, the Government is funding new initiatives to protect the most vulnerable Victorians. The Government will respond to growing demand in child protection services and improve support for all vulnerable children and their families. The Government is also working to prepare for the introduction of a National Disability Insurance Scheme to improve the assistance and support available to Victorians with a disability, as well as their families and carers. The Government is continuing to support low-income and vulnerable Victorian families who are most exposed to cost-of-living pressures. Building on last year's package of concessions, this year's budget provides additional funding for concessions for essential services such as energy, water and municipal rates. The Government is also working to provide support for those families that are hardest hit by industry transition, as the global economy continues to change. The Government is providing support services to retrenched workers, including the Victorian Training Guarantee and the Workers in Transition Program. Further, in this year's budget, the Government is providing additional support for workers and their families facing retrenchment because of structural changes in manufacturing and allied industries. This support will particularly assist workers in regional Victoria. The Government will be supporting small businesses, which are often family-run companies that drive job generation in Victoria. Initiatives include Business Victoria Online, Victoria's Small Business Festival and a new program to develop innovation and boost growth for small businesses in manufacturing. Small business is vital for the future prosperity of Victoria and these programs will help to spread the benefits across the community. The Government is supporting families in regional Victoria through initiatives to boost the productivity and competitiveness of regional economies and ensure high-quality services. The $1 billion Regional Growth Fund is building a better future in regional Victoria by improving roads and infrastructure, upgrading regional health services and creating new employment and business opportunities. The 2012-13 Budget includes upgrades to hospitals in Geelong, Ballarat, Kilmore and Castlemaine, following the investment for Bendigo Hospital redevelopment included in the 2011-12 Budget . Victorian Families have a fundamental right to feel safe in their communities. Since December 2010, the Government has been tackling crime, violence, disorder and anti-social behaviour. Central to this approach is the Government's commitment in this term to deliver the largest increase in police numbers during a single term of government in the State's history. This year's budget provides significant additional investment to assist police with much-needed infrastructure. The Government is also continuing to strengthen the justice system, abolishing suspended sentences for all serious crimes, and toughening punishments to send the message that crime will not be tolerated."

This investment includes new asset investment worth $2.7 billion, as well as the Webb Dock expansion by the Port of Melbourne. These projects will improve the State's productivity, strengthen service delivery and community infrastructure and enhance safety and security for Victorian families. The 2012-13 Budget is investing $200 million for schools infrastructure and $364 million in capital and infrastructure funding for hospitals and public health services. There will also be $4 million invested in capital grants to support community-based mental health infrastructure. The Government is continuing to support the repair of infrastructure damaged by floods and bushfires, including thousands of kilometres of main and local roads around the State. A Community Infrastructure Fund, established following the 2011 floods, is providing $30 million to councils and community groups for repairs to public halls, sporting facilities and other community assets. The 2012-13 Budget also invests in significant new road and rail infrastructure including: $350 million for the removal of level crossings at Springvale Road, Springvale and Mitcham Road and Rooks Road, Mitcham; $136 million for the construction of the Dingley Bypass, a new four-lane arterial road; and funding to purchase additional rolling stock to improve the capacity of existing regional passenger train services. These projects will relieve congestion delays, increase connectivity and reduce individual trip times to help hardworking Victorian families maintain a work-life balance."

The Government provides services such as health, education and crime prevention that, combined with a strong economy, help Victorian families to fulfil their potential independently. At times, however, some families will need additional support. The Government provides this support through targeted services that work alongside our universal services such as our broad-based health and education services. These services should all work together, not separately. Families who need targeted support often under-use universal services. For example, young people with unsafe home environments are often at risk of becoming disengaged from school. These families can sometimes miss out on the broader benefits that universal services provide. Targeted services are a pathway, not a destination. The aim is to promote families' independence, rather than a continued reliance on specialised government services. To help families make this transition and to ensure that the specialised services provided to families when they need them are as effective as possible, the Government is taking the following approach to improving the services it funds and delivers: Joined-up services - Current service systems tend to be fragmented across program and portfolio areas. Connecting services across government ensures a simpler, more positive experience for families and ensures that all the support provided to a family is working towards the same goals. It also ensures that service providers have access to good information about families' needs. Many of the most vulnerable families have complex needs and access multiple services, which makes it difficult for them to navigate the various service systems they need. Joined-up services can deliver particular benefits to these families. Family-centred services - Family-centred services give people a key role in designing and implementing solutions that work for them, including access and other assistance. Services should be built around each family's needs. A family-centred approach also ensures that when services work with individual clients, they take into account the broader needs of those clients' families. This will increase the likelihood of finding lasting solutions for vulnerable families. Prevention and early intervention focus - A stronger focus on prevention and early intervention allows service providers to tackle problems before they reach crisis. Early intervention can also support those experiencing ongoing vulnerabilities, helping them to maintain their quality of life and avoid problems intensifying. The Government aims to support effective prevention and early intervention by encouraging government-funded services and agencies to work together. Outcomes focus - In the past, service planning and funding has been based around processes and activities, rather than focused on outcomes for families. As a result, it is often difficult for government to know which strategies are effective and should be pursued and which are ineffective and should be abandoned. Designing and evaluating services based on outcomes can significantly improve government's understanding of how families can effectively manage issues and lead independent and productive lives. This section outlines the action and reforms the Government is pursuing to ensure these principles are reflected in the services we provide."

As with last year's budget, the Government is again providing funding for many significant new hospital capital projects throughout the State. In the 2012-13 Budget , the Government has provided for key projects for public hospital services from 2012-13 to 2015-16. In this year alone the Government is providing an extra $364 million in capital and infrastructure funding for hospitals and public health services. Regional services committed to in last year's budget, such as the Bendigo Hospital ($630 million), will be joined this year by commitments to key services in Geelong, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Kilmore and Charlton. In the 2012-13 Budget , the Government has allocated an additional $44 million to support elective surgery activity in hospitals to meet demand pressures and contain waiting lists. These funds will help fill the gap left by lapsing Commonwealth funding for hospital services, which had previously been provided under the National Partnership Agreement for Improving Public Hospital Services. In addition, $60 million has been allocated over four years to support the work of the Victorian Cancer Agency, including its work to translate cancer research into treatments and approaches to patient care."

A well-trained, job-ready workforce is the life-blood of Victorian business and is the largest determinant of productivity in the State's economy. Helping people train in areas of jobs growth is also one of the best ways the Government can provide Victorians with opportunities to participate in the workforce. In recent years, the Victorian VET system has changed significantly through the introduction of an individual entitlement to a subsidised training place and the opening of the market to competition between providers. The Government is retaining and strengthening these market fundamentals, to ensure that businesses and individuals have opportunities to undertake training and that they are able to choose what and where they study. In this budget, the Government is refocusing its support to better target areas of greatest public benefit and future jobs growth, while continuing to support students most in need of assistance through relatively higher subsidies, concessions and fee waivers. In education, the Government is also committed to ensuring that schools respond to the needs of each family. The Government is changing the way government schools are being run to strengthen the ability of principals, teachers and school communities to make decisions about how their schools work. Local decision making will enable schools to better serve the needs of each family in the community and, most importantly, enable children to achieve their potential. The Government also recognises that every family should be free to make choices about the right school for their children. That is why government schools are encouraged to diversify and specialise, to expand the choices available to students. That is also why the Government has created an ongoing 25 per cent link between government and non-government school funding, so families are treated fairly regardless of their choice of school. Giving families a choice also means ensuring that families can send their children to a school in their local area. The 2012-13 Budget commits $200 million to building and developing schools in many of Victoria's fastest growing communities, including funding for a new primary school in Doreen South and the acquisition of land for future new schools in areas of population growth. This additional funding builds on funding in last year's budget of $208 million for school infrastructure, of which more than $80 million was directed to special and autistic schools, constituting the biggest investment in these schools in over a decade. Some families do need extra assistance to support their children's schooling. That is why the Government is making changes to the Education Maintenance Allowance. Parents of eligible Prep students will receive a boosted payment of $200. The payment to eligible parents of primary school students will rise from $117 to $150 per student in years 1 through 6. Parents of eligible Year 7 students will receive a boosted payment of $300 per student. The payment to eligible parents of years 8 - 12 students will increase from $235 to $250 per student. The Government's 2011-12 Budget also invested an additional $101 million to improve access to kindergarten for Victorian families. This included measures to ease the financial burden on families by providing $42 million in fee relief for over 18 000 Victorian families, including many families in rural and regional Victoria."

To achieve these aims, the Government is committed to significant reform of the child protection system. This will be supported by the development of a new whole-of-government Vulnerable Children and Families Strategy, to be delivered in 2013. The Government's 2012 Victoria's Vulnerable Children, Our Shared Responsibility, Directions Paper outlines the first phase and next steps to achieve this. This year, the Government is committing to a new investment of $336 million over five years for immediate initiatives to strengthen and stabilise the system and prepare for future reform. These actions reflect our strong commitment to achieving better outcomes through joined-up, family-centred services and a greater focus on prevention and early intervention. The initiatives and directions set out in the directions paper will help ensure that the Government improves assistance and support for vulnerable children and their families across services, including: health; education; specialist services, such as adult mental health and drug and alcohol programs; and the statutory child protection system, including the Children's Court and out-of-home care. All parts of the system will be rigorously held to account to improve outcomes for vulnerable children and their families. A key step in this process of change is delivering on the Government's commitment to trial case management reform in two lead sites in Dandenong and Geelong/South West. These trials, which commenced in February 2012, worked with a number of families identified as having complex needs. The trials worked to build the capacity and independence of these families by drawing together the services they need and by focusing case management planning on the families. Over the next 12 months, the Government will invest $1 million for an external evaluation of the two reform pilots, testing ways of integrating services for clients with complex needs to inform future planning and service delivery. The Government's further efforts will be focused on supporting vulnerable families by providing access to quality universal services to boost protections that prevent families from falling into crisis and by intervening earlier at key points through targeted programs. Key investments include a further $22 million to increase the capacity of ChildFIRST (Child and Family Information, Referral and Support Teams) and Integrated Family Services to deliver more early support to families where there are concerns about the wellbeing of children. The Government will also invest $30 million over four years in the Stronger Families program, a client-centred service that provides intensive case work support to families identified by the child protection system and whose children are at imminent risk of being placed in out-of-home care. The Government's investment will continue existing services in the current four locations and expand these programs to an additional two catchment areas of high need. Some women and their partners need support during pregnancy to provide for the health, safety and development of their children. The Government will invest $4.7 million to continue the successful Healthy Mothers-Healthy Babies program. This initiative puts families at the centre of service delivery, with coordinated care and education delivered by community health services. The initiative complements the new Cradle to Kinder program, funded in the 2011-12 Budget , which provides more intensive and long-term support for vulnerable young mothers and their children. The Government will also invest $16 million in the Enhanced Maternal and Child Health program, which will work alongside the universal Maternal and Child Health program to provide additional support for families who are facing particularly challenging circumstances. The Government recognises the need to support early learning for families as a way of promoting future learning habits and preventing vulnerability. Parents are the first and most influential role models for children. The value of education is one of the most important lessons parents can impart. The Government will invest $17 million to support more playgroups, home learning support and long-term research into the impact of early childhood education and care on vulnerable children. Early learning programs are also one of the best ways to help children start school ready for life and learning. The Government is providing $8.3 million for the early start kindergarten program, which will make sure that Victoria's most vulnerable three-year olds can access quality kindergarten programs. A further challenge to improving overall outcomes for Victoria's most vulnerable children is investment in and reform of the statutory system, which includes child protection, the Children's Court and out-of-home care. As part of this year's budget, the Government will provide $19 million to expand the child protection workforce by 42 new workers. This will ease the pressure on the system and make it more responsive to families in need. This builds on last year's funding of over $19 million to recruit 47 new full-time child protection staff, bringing the total number of new child protection workers since 2010 to 89. The Government will implement a new and improved operating model for child protection, underpinned by a $51 million workforce reform package, to deliver improved career structures, training, supervision and better pay and conditions. The Government is also creating a less adversarial, more family- and child-friendly system by investing $30 million to expand the new model and family group conferencing and Aboriginal family decision making programs. This will be supported by $17million for the decentralisation of the Children's Court at Broadmeadows, including $10 million in capital works. The Government is working to increase stability and improve outcomes for children in the out-of-home care system by investing $61 million over four years to: establish time-limited permanent care and stability review teams and Aboriginal permanent care assessments; meet growing placement demand; and extend and expand the innovative Therapeutic Residential Care model for significantly more young people in care. The significant new investment for vulnerable children and their families in this year's budget builds on last year's $98 million budget boost, including: $20 million in investment for early intervention programs to help vulnerable parents cope with the challenges of raising children; and $53 million to help young people in residential care get the support they need and ensure their effective transition to independent living, including new health and education assessments, support for care leavers and enhanced placement capacity. The Government's directions paper also outlines a wide range of other reforms, legislative changes and policies that will be further developed as the Vulnerable Children and Families Strategy is finalised."

The Government values the efforts of carers and their contribution to our community. The Government knows that carers and volunteers can face many challenges and demands, often giving their time tirelessly without any reward or recognition. The Government introduced the Carers Recognition Bill into Parliament on 7 February 2012 to recognise and promote the crucial role of carers and care relationships. Services and support for people with a disability, their families and their carers are vitally important. The Victorian Government is committed to leading and driving the implementation of a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which will support people with a severe and profound activity limitation. This commitment is part of the Government's broader agenda of connecting services across government to ensure a simpler and more positive experience for users of the system. In this year's budget, the Government has committed $900 000 to prepare for being a launch site for an NDIS. The Government has also committed $38 million as part of this year's budget to fund additional Individual Support Packages (ISPs) for people with a disability. ISPs are disability services funds that are allocated to a person to meet their disability-related support needs. Users of the system should be at the centre of service delivery. This is why ISPs enable people with a disability to direct the planning process to the greatest extent possible, making their own choices about how they wish to live their lives. This funding complements the $26 million allocated through the 2011-12 Budget to the Aids and Equipment Program. This was in addition to a new $4 million top-up fund to ease the financial burden on families by providing financial support to access aids and equipment for children. As part of last year's budget, the Government allocated $41 million to Innovative Supported Accommodation, Respite Support and School Holiday Respite Support programs to support people with a disability and their families and carers. Of this, $20 million has been allocated to supported accommodation and $21 million to respite, with a particular focus on school holiday periods. A further 53 supported accommodation beds have also been secured through an additional funding commitment of more than $30 million from the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments. The Commonwealth provided the capital funding to establish the accommodation and the Victorian Government, delivering on its election commitment, has allocated more than $14 million over four years to support the successful providers to cover ongoing costs for the delivery of the new services. This new supported accommodation will provide a greater range of innovative and flexible options to meet the diverse needs of people with a disability."

We are working to better identify and respond to mental illness early, seeking to reduce its impact through providing timely community and acute care services and supporting ongoing recovery for Victorians living with a mental illness. In the 2011-12 Budget , a total of $105 million over four years was allocated to address a number of gaps in the implementation of mental health reform. This included $27 million over four years for community-based clinical treatment to provide early intervention for people who need it the most. The package also included $8.3 million over four years for home-based outreach services. These investments ensure that more Victorians can access treatment within their communities, while maintaining close links to their families and social networks. The care and support provided by Victoria's community-managed mental health services are a vital part of health and human services. In partnership with the sector, we are working on reforms that will deliver better targeted, planned and coordinated services that respond more effectively to individual needs. Victoria's Mental Health Act 1986 is the oldest mental health law in the country. The Government will deliver important legislative reform through the development of a new Mental Health Bill, which will promote the involvement of patients, carers and families and strengthen people's participation in making decisions about their treatment and recovery planning. The Government is also committed to improving early intervention services to better support young people with a mental illness. This includes expanding prevention and recovery care beds and youth mental health services, such as headspace and EPPIC. There is a growing demand for eating disorder services among young people, where they and their families can receive treatment and assistance for an often complex and severe condition. To achieve ongoing reform and improvement of our eating disorder services, the Government has established an eating disorders taskforce to make recommendations for a Victorian eating disorders strategy. The Government will soon be opening a new intensive day patient program for young people with eating disorders at the Royal Children's Hospital. Through the budget the Government has also provided ongoing funding for two existing eating disorder projects that were due to lapse. The Government is also committed to taking the pressure off Victoria's emergency departments by investing in additional Psychiatric Assessment and Planning Units beds and new acute mental health beds through this year's budget. Strong family relationships are important to ensure that Victorians with a mental illness are supported in their recovery and are able to participate in the community. That is why the Government is delivering new family-focused mental health initiatives, including three new five-bed regional Mother-Baby Mental Health Services to provide assessment and treatment in a safe and calm environment for women experiencing post-natal depression and their children. Mental health issues frequently have a relationship to drug and alcohol abuse. The Victorian Alcohol and Drug Strategy will set out how the Government will approach alcohol, pharmaceutical drugs, illicit drugs and treatment for addiction over the next 10 years. In preparing this strategy, the Government will ensure current investment aimed at reducing the harms of alcohol and drug use is delivering the best results. The 2012-13 Budget will kick-start this reform agenda. The Government has already doubled the pharmacotherapy budget and has expanded needle and syringe programs to reduce the harm caused to the community by illicit drugs. This budget also funds a new therapeutic counselling, consultancy and continuing care service that builds on the new services announced in the 2011-12 Budget . Risky drinkers are increasingly present at emergency departments, hospital treatment centres and in the criminal justice system. This is why, as a first measure, the Government is investing in more support for clinicians dealing with alcohol-related emergency department cases. The Government is committed to taking action to ensure that Victorians of all ages with mental health, alcohol or drug abuse problems can receive help earlier, with treatment and support focused on reducing the often devastating health, social and economic impact of these issues."

This new approach will improve connections between government services and create new partnerships between government and the community sector.

A Community Infrastructure Fund was established following the 2011 floods, providing $30 million to councils and community groups for repairs to public halls, sporting facilities and other community assets. The Government's flood and natural disaster response is not just about repairing assets. It is also about supporting local communities to maintain their economic self-sufficiency. A range of recovery support has been provided to families following the 2011 and 2012 floods, including personal hardship payments, temporary accommodation assistance, case work support and counselling programs. These floods hit rural communities particularly hard and specific support has been provided to farmers and rural families through clean-up grants, low-interest loans, off-farm employment programs and financial counselling. The Government also recognised the personal, social and emotional impact of these events and has supported families and local communities through direct support in affected communities. The Government continues to support families and communities recovering from the Black Saturday bushfires, including through advice and assistance in rebuilding homes and businesses."

The Government will recruit 1 700 extra frontline police officers by November 2014 to protect communities across Victoria. This is the largest single increase in frontline police numbers ever made in one term of government in Victoria. Over the past 12 months, significant progress has been made towards realising this target and making our communities safer. The Government's record commitment is allowing Victoria Police to increase police presence where it is needed to make communities safer. One example is the establishment of a Victoria Police Command Post on the Richmond public housing estate to address the sale and use of drugs. Additional closed circuit television cameras have also been installed and residents are already reporting they feel safer and that anti-social and illegal behaviour has decreased. A successful recruitment campaign is underway to recruit and train new police officers. Targets have been set to ensure that this goal is realised. In 2011-12, the Police Academy received $18 million to upgrade facilities to enable the effective training of the new recruits and $34 million was provided to fund the first stage of the Government's election commitment for new police stations and police station upgrades. The 2012-13 Budget includes $49 million for a program of capital works at various police stations across the State to accommodate the additional frontline police and Protective Services Officers provided for in the 2011-12 Budget . In addition, the Government will invest $48 million dollars to construct new and upgrade existing police stations at various locations, including at Waurn Ponds and Emerald, and the Essendon Operational Tactics and Safety Training complex. The Government understands that people across the community are concerned about their safety on public transport, particularly at night, with surveys showing that less than a third of respondents feel safe travelling on public transport after dark (see Chart 6)."

As part of the 2012-13 Budget , the Government is investing $16 million over four years to upgrade the Victorian State Emergency Service's information technology systems to ensure that they can be used in incident control centres, which are operated by the Country Fire Authority. This responds directly to the recommendations of the Review of the 2010-11 Flood Warnings and Response into the 2011 floods. In September 2011, the Government published the Emergency Management Green Paper Towards a More Disaster Resilient and Safer Victoria , which outlines options for major reform of Victoria's emergency management framework to support more disaster resilient communities. A White Paper will be published later in 2012. The Government is also working to strengthen emergency planning activities to support vulnerable people in Victorian communities. In this budget, the Government is providing funding of $10 million over four years towards the Vulnerable People in Emergencies Program to enable local governments to identify and register, through a web-based database, vulnerable people who would be at risk in emergencies, including vulnerable people who do not attend or receive municipal or state-delivered services. This supports the ongoing response to the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. Work has also commenced on reducing the risks of bushfires caused by power lines, another recommendation of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. The work program includes a $200 million plan to replace the most dangerous power lines in the State, of which $40 million will be used to address the impact on vulnerable Victorians due to changes in the network. In addition, the Government has committed to increase the level of planned burning on public land, consistent with the recommendations of the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission. Increasing planned burning is one of a number of measures that the Government is taking to protect the community and the environment from the impacts of bushfires."

It will also support Victoria's participation in nation-leading longitudinal research investigating the impact of early childhood education and care on children's outcomes. Strengthening student support services $4.0 million The student support service is being reformed by the devolution of resources to principals in school clusters. Student support services operate in government schools to directly support students facing barriers to achieving their educational and developmental potential and to build teacher capacity to better respond to the needs of vulnerable children. By returning staff to school-based clusters, these professional support officers will allow for greater responsiveness to students and student communities' needs. Sustaining the Enhanced Maternal and Child Health Service $16.3 million The enhanced Maternal and Child Health service will enable the provision of additional support to parents who are disadvantaged, isolated or have babies with significant health problems and need extra assistance. This funding ensures that intensive support will continue to be available to vulnerable families.

Conferencing provides an opportunity to engage children's families, put plans in place that will keep children safe and divert the need for more formal protective intervention. The Aboriginal Family Decision Making program will be expanded to contribute to reducing the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in the child protection system. The routine use of Family Group Conferencing will be piloted for two years (2013-14 and 2014-15) and will be evaluated to consider the program's effectiveness and its capacity to divert children safely from further involvement by child protection services.
