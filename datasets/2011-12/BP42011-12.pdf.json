Budget Paper No. 4 provides an overview of the asset investments delivered by departments and controlled entities in the coming financial year. The capital investments in programs and projects published in this budget paper are those that are currently being undertaken or where work will commence in 2011-12 to support the provision of future public services. Budget Paper No. 4 is prepared by the Department of Treasury and Finance (DTF) with input from across the general government sector and the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sector. It should be noted that project details reflect the intentions and priorities as at 20 April 2011. However, capital investment initiatives are rarely static and it can be expected that some rescheduling will occur over the course of the year. The Victorian Economic and Financial Statement released in April 2011 highlights the fiscal and economic challenges confronting the Government, including significant cost pressures across a number of high-value and high-risk infrastructure projects. The Statement foreshadows the broad direction of reform the Government will pursue in order to address these challenges over time and the measures being implemented to tackle the pattern of cost pressures in the State's major projects. Budget Paper No. 2 Strategy and Outlook describes the State's economic and financial position and performance while also outlining the Government's fiscal and economic reform strategy. Budget Paper No. 3 Service Delivery provides an overview of the goods and services funded by the Government and delivered by departments in the coming financial year and describes how these services support the Government's strategic priorities and objectives. This includes descriptions of new capital investment initiatives announced in the 2011-12 Budget for the general government sector. Budget Paper No. 5 Statement of Finances provides the financial details of the aggregated Victorian general government sector as outlined in Budget Paper No. 2."

This investment results in the production, enhancement and acquisition of non-current physical assets. The State's asset portfolio is deployed through both the general government sector (e.g. government departments) and the PNFC sector (e.g. urban and regional water authorities). It includes road and railway networks, information technology systems, research facilities, schools, hospitals and social housing, as well as water storage and distribution infrastructure, correctional centres, courts, cultural assets such as historic museum collections, and environmental assets such as public reserves, parks and public open space. In the 2011-12 Budget , the Government has taken immediate action to improve the delivery of the State Capital Program while ensuring value for money and delivering its commitments despite very tight fiscal constraints. These fiscal constraints are partly attributable to reduced GST and other revenue from the Commonwealth, but also due to cost pressures associated with existing capital investment projects. As outlined in the Victorian Economic and Financial Statement , the potential impact of cost pressures across a number of high-value and high-risk infrastructure projects is in the order of $2 billion. The Government is managing the cost and delivery pressures facing the Regional Rail Link project in the 2011-12 Budget , while the future of other major projects is subject to the outcome of project reviews. To help ensure capital overruns of this magnitude are minimised in the future, the Government has implemented greater rigour in developing, approving and implementing its capital program, in particular for high-value and high-risk investments. High-value and high-risk asset investments have been defined as those that: \u2022 have a total estimated investment (TEI) greater than $100 million, regardless of the funding source; \u2022 are identified as high risk, using an approved risk assessment tool; or \u2022 are determined by the Government as warranting the rigour of increased oversight."

Gateway reviews are peer reviews which occur at six project decision points and are designed to improve investment selection, management and delivery for the State through assuring the use of robust processes for project planning, business case development, project delivery and reporting. The initial set of high-value and high-risk projects subject to the increased oversight include: \u2022 all new projects for the 2011-12 Budget that fall within the high-value and high-risk definition; and \u2022 existing infrastructure projects that are subject to significant budgetary and or delivery risks. Other projects will remain under review and will be subject to the new oversight process if their particular circumstances deteriorate. The enhanced planning and governance processes will help ensure that: \u2022 projects are more clearly linked to the intended service delivery outcome; \u2022 best value for money projects are selected for delivery; \u2022 project costing and timing are more rigorously tested; \u2022 the most efficient and appropriate procurement and governance models are used in project delivery; and \u2022 high-value and high-risk projects are effectively monitored and managed throughout construction and commissioning."

Provision has been made for additional contingency funding for this project in order to meet a range of cost pressures. A revised TEI is not reported at this time due to commercial sensitivities. (b) This is a Partnerships Victoria project. The finance lease value of this project is $4.2 billion which represents the capital component of the project, which is the total estimated capital cost including certain financing costs incurred by the private sector, but excludes the State's associated project delivery costs, and finance, operating and maintenance costs over the operating phase of the project contract. (c) Incorporates additional funding of $102 million provided in the 2011-12 Budget to expand the scope of the project. Notes (continued): (d) The original estimated capital cost for this project was $461 million (plus $890 million in operating costs). This project is facing cost pressures and is under review. (e) Incorporates additional funding of $40 million provided in the 2011-12 Budget for 100 additional beds. (f) The West Gate Bridge rehabilitation project is subject to cost pressures but is expected to achieve practical completion by 30 June 2011. The final cost will be subject to commercial negotiations. (g) The original government funding for this project was $218 million. This project is facing cost pressures and is under review. (h) This is a new project which makes provision for seven X'Trapolis trains as Stage 1 of a rolling stock procurement program for 40 new trains. (i) The TEI reflects the approved capital budget funding but excludes $165 million in operating and agency costs. This project is facing cost pressures and is under review. (j) The increase of $13 million in TEI from 2010-11 largely reflects additional scope required to complete the project. Table 1 does not include the LINK police database project, which was allocated $61 million by the previous government in 2005 to replace Victoria Police's operations management IT system (LEAP). This project has been subject to significant cost and delivery pressures, and was recently stopped pending redevelopment of the business case. Table 2 includes high-value and high-risk initiatives that are either announced in this budget to start construction in 2011-12 or are larger projects which will be considered for funding and delivery in future budgets.

In implementing these changes, the Government has ensured the overall level of disclosure compared to past budget papers has been maintained or enhanced. The following narrative describes the revised structure and highlights the major changes compared to the 2010-11 Public Sector Asset Investment Program . Structure For each sector, department or agency, the capital investments are listed in the chapters as either: \u2022 'New' - general government sector projects announced by the Government as part of the 2011-12 Budget or, in the case of PNFCs, new projects approved by the entity's board; or \u2022 'Existing' - projects that have previously been announced and delivery will be continuing as at 1 July 2011. The projects in this publication are listed with their location and grouped according to the organisation delivering the projects. Details of TEIs are provided with projected investment expenditures on individual projects for 2010-11 and beyond. Chapter 1 - Public sector capital program 2011-12 Chapter 1 details the infrastructure investment by TEI and provides summaries by sector, by departments in the general government sector, and by agency in the PNFC sector. Chapter 2 - General government capital program 2011-12 Chapter 2 details the infrastructure investment by TEI for each individual project or program in the general government sector. All general government sector projects with a TEI equal to, or in excess of, $250 000 are published. Chapter 3 - Public non-financial corporations capital program 2011-12 Chapter 3 details the infrastructure investment by TEI for each individual project or program in the PNFC sector. For the PNFC sector, only projects with a TEI equal to, or in excess of, $1 million are separately listed, with the aggregate value of other projects not individually identified captured in the 'Other' category. Budget Paper No. 4 does not include: \u2022 capital grants paid to other sectors; or \u2022 existing general government sector projects with a planned capital expenditure in 2011-12 of less than $75 000 and PNFC projects that have planned capital expenditure in 2011-12 of less than $150 000. For the purposes of this publication these projects are considered complete."

Budget Paper No. 4 State Capital Program provides a summary of the Government's capital program from the perspectives of sectors, organisations and individual infrastructure projects. Chapter 1 and subsequent chapters of Budget Paper No. 4 provide listings of projects that meet specific criteria (as outlined in the Introduction). The broad and diverse capital program outlined demonstrates the Government's commitment to deliver world-class infrastructure to enhance social, economic, environmental and cultural outcomes across the State. The total estimated investment (TEI) of the capital program included in this publication is $34.8 billion, with $15.4 billion worth of projects in the general government sector and the remaining $19.4 billion provided through the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) sector entities listed in Chapter 3. For the 2011-12 financial year the Government has committed to a total expenditure in infrastructure of about $7.4 billion to support service delivery, which represents 21 per cent of the $34.8 billion TEI committed for the total capital program referred to above. Further expenditure for the delivery of infrastructure will occur over a number of years and this is reflected in the project listings provided in this document."

Partnerships Victoria is a framework that provides a whole of government approach to the provision of infrastructure and related ancillary services through public private partnerships. It focuses on whole of life costing and full consideration of project risks and optimal risk allocation between the public and private sectors. The framework includes an oversight structure consistent with that outlined for high-value and high-risk projects. Public private partnership delivery is most useful for major and complex capital projects with opportunities for innovation and risk transfer. The choice between public and private provision of infrastructure and associated services is based on an assessment of value for money and public interest considerations. This framework ensures that procurement decisions are based on merit and outcomes are judged on the public benefits obtained. The majority of Partnerships Victoria projects are government funded through availability payments and financed by the private sector. There are currently 21 Partnerships Victoria projects contracted with a capital investment of approximately $10.5 billion. Of these 21 projects, 15 have been commissioned and are now operational and six are under construction. In addition to these 21, one project is in its procurement stage."

Contributions from the private sector (for example from developers providing assets free of charge to entities in the water sector) also add to the asset base of the sector. For all projects valued over set thresholds, PNFC entities are required to submit a detailed business case of the proposal to the Department of Treasury and Finance (DTF). These are reviewed and evaluated by DTF before the Treasurer's approval is obtained. The threshold is set for a particular entity in accordance with a three tier approach, being $10 million, $20 million or $50 million, depending on the relative size and risk of the PNFC entity. The three thresholds have been developed to ensure that the business case review and acceptance process focuses on those projects that are complex, high-value and high-risk in nature. The assessment of the appropriate threshold for an individual PNFC is based on the size and risk of each entity. Included in Table 1.3 are projected investments in 2011-12 by PNFCs or entities.

(c) These totals include the total estimated investment (TEI) for the Melbourne Wholesale Markets redevelopment of $208 million (previously approved government contribution only) and remaining expenditure of $70 million. The reduction in TEI from the previously published amount of $218 million for the Melbourne Wholesale Markets redevelopment is a result of a $11 million transfer from asset funding to output funding and an amount of $96 000 retained by the Department of Primary Industries as part of the earlier machinery of government change where the project transferred to the Department of Business and Innovation."

Total existing projects 3 426 212 2 692 209 620 340 113 663 Source: Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Notes: (a) The TEI for this project has changed as a result of rephasing within the school capital program. This rephasing may be due to a range of factors including inclement weather, latent soil conditions and adverse tender results. The total cost to deliver the school capital program to the Department has not changed. Notes (continued): (b) Published in the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development section for the first time as project approval by the previous government was received after the publication of 2010-11 Public Sector Asset Investment Program . (c) The TEI has decreased by $553 000 as a result of rephasing within the school capital program. Expenditure on this project may be deferred due to Koori cultural heritage issues. (d) Published in the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development section for the first time as project approval by the previous government was received after the publication of 2010-11 Public Sector Asset Investment Program . (e) This project was omitted from 2010-11 Public Sector Asset Investment Program but has been reinstated for 2011-12. (f) The TEI decreased by $5.0 million in accordance with the decision of the previous government. This $5.0 million was redirected towards the Broadmeadows Special Development School project. (g) The published TEI has been amended by $44 million since last year's publication to reflect the total project cost. The TEI and cash flow changes will be met from the Government's contribution and other funding sources including proceeds from the sale of land and contributions from Kangan Batman Institute of TAFE. (h) Published in the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development section for the first time due to machinery of government changes. Previously published under Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development. (i) Funding published in the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development section for the first time due to machinery of government changes. Previously published under Department of Planning and Community Development. (j) The TEI has decreased by $4.0 million as this amount represents the State's contribution to the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce."
