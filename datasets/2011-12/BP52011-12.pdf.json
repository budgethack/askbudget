This information supports that presented in Budget Paper No. 2 Strategy and Outlook . Budget Paper No. 5 also includes the general government sector's financial outcomes for the nine months to 31 March 2011. This budget paper takes into account the financial impacts of all policy decisions taken by the Victorian Government, as well as Commonwealth Government funding revisions and other information that affects the projected general government sector Estimated Financial Statements as at 21 April 2011, unless otherwise stated. Budget Paper No. 5 forms part of a suite of budget papers. The Victorian Economic and Financial Statement released on 14 April 2011 highlights the fiscal and economic challenges confronting the Government, including significant program and capital project cost pressures. The statement outlines the broad direction of reform the Government will pursue in order to address these challenges over time. Budget Paper No. 2 Strategy and Outlook describes the State's economic and financial position and performance while also outlining the Government's fiscal and economic reform strategy. Budget Paper No. 3 Service Delivery provides an overview of the goods and services to be funded by the Government and delivered by departments in the coming financial year and how these services support the Government's strategic priorities and objectives. This includes descriptions of new output and asset investment initiatives announced in the 2011-12 Budget for the general government sector. Budget Paper No. 4 State Capital Program is published to inform Parliament and the community about Victoria's capital program. Budget Paper No. 4 provides an overview of the asset investments funded by the Government and delivered by departments and controlled entities in the coming financial year. Budget Paper No. 5 Statement of Finances (previously Budget Paper No. 4), incorporates several changes to content and presentation, aiming to improve the utility of the overall Budget Paper suite to Parliament and the community. More specifically, financial summary tables previously presented in Chapter 3 Departmental Financial Statements outlining total expenses by department, purchases of non-financial assets by department and Parliamentary authority for resources; are now presented in Budget Paper No. 3 Service Delivery to strengthen linkages between departmental service delivery objectives and targets, and the financial resources applied. Historical and Forward Estimates Tables , previously Appendix A, are also now available online on the Department of Treasury and Finance website as well as being presented in Appendix C, whilst previous Appendices B and C have been consolidated into the new Appendix B for improved ease of reference. Budget Paper No. 5 consists of the following chapters and appendices."

Variations in these assumed conditions, such as international developments and other risks to the national economy, from which Victoria would not be immune, may cause the Victorian general government sector actual result to differ from the projections. Accordingly, no guarantee is given that the financial results will be achieved. However, appropriate professional judgement has been applied in preparing the Estimated Financial Statements.

The statements, including the estimated Victorian general government sector's investment in other sectors, have been prepared having regard to applicable Australian Accounting Standards. As there is no specific Australian accounting standard or other authoritative pronouncement that prescribes the preparation and presentation of prospective financial statements, the Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared based on the principles set out in the New Zealand Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements (FRS 42).

(A) Statement   of   compliance   These Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23H-23K of the Financial Management Act 1994 , having regard to Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). AASs include Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). In particular, the Estimated Financial Statements are presented in a manner consistent with the principles of AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting (AASB 1049). However, the prospective nature of these Estimated Financial Statements means that some AAS disclosures are neither relevant nor practical and so these have been omitted. Further, where appropriate, those AAS paragraphs relevant to not-for-profit entities have been applied. Because AAS do not include pronouncements that prescribe the preparation and presentation of prospective financial statements, the Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared having regard to the principles set out in New Zealand Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements . The Government Finance Statistics (GFS) information included in this report is based on the GFS manual published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS ), Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods 2005 Cat. No. 5514.0 . The information presented in the Estimated Financial Statements takes into account all policy decisions taken by the Victorian Government, as well as known Commonwealth Government funding revisions and circumstances that may have a material effect on the Estimated Financial Statements as at 21 April 2011. (B) Basis   of   accounting,   preparation   and   measurement   The Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared for the 2011-12 budget year in accordance with accounting policies expected to be used in preparing historically orientated general purpose financial statements for that year, and the same accounting policies have been used for the subsequent forecast years. The accrual basis of accounting has been applied in the preparation of the Estimated Financial Statements whereby assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses are recognised in the reporting period to which they relate, regardless of when cash is received or paid. The Estimated Financial Statements are presented in Australian dollars which is also the functional currency of the Victorian general government sector."

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on professional judgements derived from historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and also in future periods that are affected by the revision. The Estimated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. Historical cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. Exceptions to the historical cost convention include: \u2022 general government sector investments in other sector entities which are measured at the proportional share of net asset value; \u2022 non-financial physical assets which, subsequent to acquisition, are measured at a revalued amount being their fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent impairment losses. Revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amounts do not materially differ from their fair value; \u2022 productive trees in commercial native forests, which are recognised at their fair value less costs to sell; \u2022 derivative financial instruments, managed investment schemes, certain debt securities and investment properties after initial recognition, which are measured at fair value with changes reflected in the estimated consolidated comprehensive operating statement (fair value through profit and loss); \u2022 certain liabilities, most notably unfunded superannuation and some insurance claim provisions, which are subject to an actuarial assessment; and \u2022 available-for-sale investments which are measured at fair value with movements reflected in 'Other economic flows - other movements in equity'. As required by AASB 1049, the consolidated comprehensive operating statement distinguishes between 'transactions' and 'other economic flows' based on the principles in the ABS GFS manual. Transactions are defined as economic flows that arise as a result of government policy decisions, usually an interaction between two entities by mutual agreement. Taxation is regarded under GFS as mutually agreed between the government and the taxpayer. Transactions also include flows within an organisation such as depreciation because the owner is seen as simultaneously acting as the owner of the depreciating asset and the consumer of the service provided by the asset. Transactions may be settled in kind or for cash. Economic flows are changes arising from market remeasurements or other changes in the volume of assets. They include gains and losses from disposals, revaluations and impairments of non-financial physical and intangible assets; actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit superannuation plans; fair value changes of financial instruments and agricultural assets; and depletion of natural assets (non-produced) from their use or removal."

To gain a better understanding of the terminology and key aggregates used in this report, a glossary of terms can be found in Note 38 of the 2009-10 Annual Financial Report . (C) Reporting   entity   The Estimated Financial Statements are prepared for the Victorian general government sector which includes all government departments, offices and other bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. The primary function of entities within the Victorian general government sector is to provide public services (outputs), which are mainly non-market in nature, for the collective consumption of the community, and involve the transfer or redistribution of revenue that is financed mainly through taxes and other compulsory levies. The Victorian general government sector is not a separate entity but represents a sector within the State of Victoria whole of government reporting entity. Unless otherwise noted, accounting policies applied by the State apply equally to the Victorian general government sector. (D) Basis   of   consolidation   The Estimated Financial Statements present the consolidated assets and liabilities of all reporting entities in the Victorian general government sector, and their revenue, gains and expenses for the respective period, consistent with the principles of AASB 1049 and AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements . Entities in the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors are not consolidated into the financial statements of the Victorian general government sector, but are accounted for as equity investments measured at the Government's proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets of the PNFC and PFC sector entities before consolidation eliminations. Where the carrying amount of the entities' net assets before consolidation eliminations is less than zero, the amount is not included. Any change in the carrying amount of the investment from period to period is accounted for as if the change in carrying amount is a change in fair value and accounted for in a manner consistent with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and AASB 1049. Where control of an entity is expected to be obtained during the financial period, its results are included in the estimated consolidated comprehensive operating statement from the date on which control will commence. Where control is expected to cease during a financial period, the entity's results are included for that part of the period for which control would exist. Where dissimilar accounting policies are adopted by entities and their effect is considered material, adjustments are made to ensure consistent policies are adopted in the Estimated Financial Statements."

Taxation   revenue   The State's taxation revenue is forecast by a process that involves: \u2022 an assessment of economic and other factors influencing the tax bases from which taxes are sourced (e.g. for payroll tax, an assessment of the outlook for employment and wages; for motor vehicle taxes, an assessment of the outlook for demand for vehicles; for gambling taxes, an assessment of the outlook for consumer spending); \u2022 analysis of historical information and relationships using econometric and other statistical methods; and \u2022 consultation with private sector economists, industry associations, and relevant government authorities. Grant   revenue   and   expenses   The forecast receipt of financial assistance from the Commonwealth is determined on the latest available information at the time of preparation of the Estimated Financial Statements, taking into account the payment schedules and escalation factors relevant to each type of grant. Forecasts of goods and services tax (GST) grants are based on the State's assessment of the latest Commonwealth information on the national GST pool. Victoria's share of GST for 2011-12 is based on Victoria's assessed relativity for that year published by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the Commonwealth Government's population projections. The Commonwealth Grants Commission calculates an assessed relativity as the average of the past three annual per capita relativities. The Victorian Government forecasts future assessed relativities by assuming that annual per capita relativities will move over the forecast period to equal the current (2011-12) assessed relativity. These annual projections are then adjusted for the latest available estimates of non-GST Commonwealth grants and their distribution across states and territories to generate a preliminary estimate of assessed relativities. To reduce volatility in the projections, each preliminary estimate is then averaged with the current (2011-12) assessed relativity generating the final estimate of Victoria's assessed relativities for each year. The forecast GST share is based on these final estimated assessed relativities and the Commonwealth Government's population projections. Grants and other transfer payments are forecast on the basis of known activity and adjusted by the appropriate economic parameters. Where payments are tied to third party revenue, such as Commonwealth grants for on-passing, forecasts are in line with estimated receipts."

Employee   expenses   Employee expenses are forecast on the basis of staffing profiles and current salaries, conditions and on-costs. For the forecast period, employee expenses are adjusted for approved wage agreements, with allowance made for further adjustments consistent with wages policy beyond the period of the agreements. Employee expense forecasts also reflect the impact of new initiatives. Depreciation   Depreciation is forecast on the basis of known asset profiles, asset sales programs and approved new asset investment programs. The expense is based on the assumption that there will be no change in depreciation rates over the forecast period, but includes the estimated impact of future revaluation of assets. However, any future changes in depreciable lives, carrying value, residual value or methodology would result in a change in future depreciation expense.

Land,   buildings,   infrastructure,   plant   and   equipment   The value of non-financial physical assets will change during the forecast period to account for acquisitions, disposals and the impact of depreciation and revaluation. New investments in assets are valued at the forecast purchase price or, where appropriate, recognised progressively over the estimated construction period. The forward estimates include the estimated impact of revaluations of non-financial physical assets. These estimates have been derived based on examination and extrapolation of historical trends in asset revaluations by major asset class. Borrowings   Estimates for borrowings are based on the ability to repay maturing debt and the need to finance capital expenditure. The forecast for finance lease liabilities across the forward estimates period relates primarily to the expected commissioning of public private partnerships. Payables   Payables consist of accounts payable, unearned revenue including deferred revenue from concession arrangements and taxes such as goods and services tax and fringe benefit tax. Estimates of accounts payables are based on known movements in contractual arrangements, other outstanding payables and historical experience. Unearned income liability relating to concession arrangements will reduce each year as income is progressively brought to account over the remaining period of the concession term. The estimated changes in other components are based on historical experience. The indemnity payable to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which relates to the electricity supply arrangements with Alcoa Australia Ltd's aluminium smelters at Point Henry and Portland, is estimated based on expected market aluminium prices and with reference to forecast electricity prices. Employee   benefits   Employee benefits are forecast on the basis of staffing profiles and current salaries and conditions. For the forecast period, employee benefits are adjusted for approved wage agreements with an allowance made for future movements.

In addition, these arrangements may include operational and maintenance services for a specified period of time. Prior to finalisation of tender arrangements, the forecasts assume that a project will be built directly by government. At the end of a tender phase, the forecasts are revised to reflect the actual provisions of the contracts. This typically includes payments by government allocated between a finance lease component for the asset use and a component accounted for as a commitment for the future operating and maintenance costs. Some service concessions arrangements, such as user pays toll roads, also include the right of the State to receive the asset at the end of the lease period. As there is currently no authoritative accounting guidance to forecast the recognition and measurement of these assets, they are not recognised in the Estimated Financial Statements. (H) Sensitivity   analysis    Appendix B Sensitivity Analysis table contained in Budget Paper No. 2, provides an estimate of the impact on income, expenses, the net result from transactions and the net result associated with variations to forecasts of selected economic and financial variables."

In addition, information for the whole of state has been included, representing the consolidated estimates of the general government, the non-financial public and the public financial sectors. The presentation of estimates data for the public financial corporations sector and whole of state is occurring for the first time. These financial statements are also presented in a format consistent with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting, which has been adopted as the presentation framework under the Uniform Presentation Framework. In addition, the chapter includes the Loan Council Allocation estimates (the government's net call on financial markets in a given financial year to meet its budget obligations), and details of Victoria's infrastructure projects with private sector investment where contracts are expected to be signed in 2011-12.

Therefore such grants are not recognised by RFC. (b) Capital gains on the investment portfolios of the State's insurance agencies (Victorian Workcover Authority, Transport Accident Commission and Victorian Managed Insurance Authority) are classified as other economic flows.

                    "text": "As required under the UPF, Victoria is required to publish its Loan Council Allocation (LCA) estimates. The LCA is a measure of the Government's net call on financial markets in a given financial year to meet its budget obligations. The method of public release is the responsibility of each individual jurisdiction. Victoria discloses its LCA information through the Financial Report for the State of Victoria, Budget Paper No. 5 Statement of Finances , and its budget update. Table 2.25 compares the Victorian 2011-12 LCA nomination approved by the Loan Council in April 2011 (based on 2010-11 Budget Update estimates), with the 2011-12 LCA budget estimate (based on 2011-12 Budget estimates). Table   2.25:   Loan   Council   Allocation   ($   million)    2011 \u2010 12   Budget      Nomination   Estimate   General government cash deficit (+)   607.2  1 334.4  Public non\u2010financial corporations sector cash deficit (+)  2 692.4  3 609.6  Non\u2010financial public sector cash deficit (+) (a)  3 319.4  4 996.8  Acquisitions under finance leases and similar arrangements  5 278.9  5 453.9  ABS GFS cash deficit(+)  8 598.3  10 450.7  Net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes (b)   4.5   24.4  Memorandum items (c)    666.5    668.4  Loan   Council   Allocation   9   260.3   11   094.7   Tolerance limit (d)  1 018.6  1 013.1  Notes: (a) The sum of the cash deficit of the general government sector and the public non-financial corporations sector does not directly equal the non-financial public sector cash deficit due to inter-sectoral transfers, which are netted out in the calculation of the non-financial public sector figure. The non-financial public sector cash deficit excludes finance lease acquisitions. (b) The ABS GFS cash deficit is adjusted to include in the LCA the impact of net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes. (c) The ABS GFS cash deficit is adjusted to include in the LCA the impact of memorandum items, which include certain transactions that have many of the characteristics of public sector borrowings but do not constitute formal borrowings (e.g. operating leases). They also include, where appropriate, transactions that the Loan Council has agreed should not be included in the LCA (e.g. the over/under funding of employers' emerging costs under public sector superannuation schemes, or borrowings by entities such as statutory marketing authorities). (d) A tolerance limit equal to 2 per cent of total non-financial public sector cash receipts from operating activities applies to the movement between a jurisdiction's LCA nomination and LCA budget estimate (calculated using estimates in the 2010-11 Budget Update ), and again between the LCA budget estimate and LCA outcome (calculated using estimates in the 2011-12 Budget ). The tolerance limit applying to the movement between Victoria's 2011-12 LCA nomination and its LCA budget estimate is $1 018.6 million (2 per cent of $50 929.0 million). The tolerance limit applying to the movement between Victoria's 2011-12 LCA budget estimate and LCA outcome is $1 013.1 million (2 per cent of $50 652.8 million). As part of the Loan Council arrangements, the Loan Council has agreed that if at any time a state or territory finds that it is likely to exceed its tolerance limit, in either direction, it is required to make a public explanation. Victoria's 2011-12 LCA budget estimate of $11.1 billion exceeded the tolerance limit established under the LCA nomination process, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in the non-financial public sector cash deficit as a result of higher infrastructure investment in both the general government sector and public non-financial corporations sector, as well as a downward revision to the general government sector's projected net cash flows from operating activities. In the interests of transparency, the State is also required to disclose the details of new infrastructure projects with private sector involvement that are expected to be contracted during the LCA year, and to report the full contingent exposure, if any. Exposure is to be measured by the Government's termination liabilities in a case of private sector default and disclosed as a footnote to, rather than a component of the LCA. The amount payable will not exceed the fair market value of the project (which is usually calculated by an independent valuer) less any costs incurred by the Government as a result of the default. Listed below are details of the public private partnership (PPP) project which is expected to be contracted during the 2011-12 financial year."

The VCCC aims to drive leadership and innovation in the fields of cancer treatment, research and education by having the largest concentration of cancer clinicians and researchers in the southern hemisphere, ranking it among the top cancer centres in the world. Capital costs of the project are to be funded by the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments, contributing $426 million and $429 million, respectively, and will be complemented by the sale of surplus assets, partner contributions and philanthropic donations. A private consortium will design, build, finance and maintain the VCCC facilities, with responsibility of all core clinical, research and education services to be retained by the project members, including the State. Financial close is now expected to occur in the first quarter of 2011-12, and construction completed by late 2015. There are no other PPP projects that are currently expected to be signed during the 2011-12 financial year."

The difference between these represents the net asset position, which is an indicator of the State's equity interest in the department. \u2022 The cash flow statement shows all movements of cash (cash receipts and payments). The cash impact of financing and investing activities on departmental resources is also shown in this statement. \u2022 The statement of changes in equity adds together the net result from transactions from the operating statement and items directly recognised in equity, such as the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, to present total changes in equity. \u2022 The administered items statement provides details of the department's administered revenue and expenses, and its administered assets and liabilities. By their nature, most if not all administered items are expensed and paid in cash in the year in which the item is recognised.

                    "text": "This chapter describes the major categories of revenue, comprising both state-sourced revenue and Commonwealth Government grants, and examines the expected movement in revenue between the 2010-11 revised estimates and the 2011-12 Budget estimates. As shown in Table 4.1, general government sector revenue is expected to increase by $2 billion in 2011-12 to $47.4 billion.

Taxation revenue in 2011-12 is expected to be $15.4 billion, an increase of $511 million or 3.4 per cent on the 2010-11 revised estimate. This increase primarily reflects: \u2022 growth in payroll tax revenue due to higher than expected growth in employment and wages; \u2022 increased revenue from taxes on insurance reflecting an expected increase in insurance contributions to fire brigades and in non-life insurance revenue. The increase in contributions to fire brigades reflects continued investment in the state's fire services. The growth in non-life insurance revenue is driven by growth in the economy and premium rate increases due to rising risks from natural disasters; \u2022 an increase in gambling tax revenue in line with household consumption expenditure growth and the impact of changes to Crown Casino's licence conditions and taxation arrangements; and \u2022 higher motor vehicle taxes which is underpinned by an increasing volume of cars and motorcycles stimulated by improved affordability and an increase in registration fees in line with the CPI. \u2022 The increase in these taxation revenues is partly offset by a decrease in taxes on property in 2011-12, both land transfer duty and land tax. Revenue from land transfer duty is expected to weaken in 2011-12, reflecting lower property market turnover due in part to the impact of higher interest rates and the impact of new policy measures. The decline in land tax reflects the impact of a small carryover of revenue into 2010-11, combined with the continued disaggregation of land holdings which incur a lower rate of tax. Interest revenue is estimated to be $576 million in 2011-12. This will be $211 million or 57.7 per cent higher than the 2010-11 revised estimates, primarily reflecting the interest payment associated with the finance lease arrangement for the Victorian desalination plant. Dividend, income tax and rate equivalent revenue is expected to be $575 million in 2011-12, which is $167 million (40.9 per cent) higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate, mainly reflecting higher dividend revenue due to the deferral of dividends from the metropolitan water businesses. Revenue from sales of goods and services is estimated to be $6.5 billion in 2011-12, an increase of 8.3 per cent or $496 million on the 2010-11 revised estimate. This is driven by the one-off impact of payments from Melbourne Water Corporation which were previously recognised as revenue in 2009-10 and 2010-11 and will now be recognised as revenue in 2011-12 when the desalination plant is commissioned. Total grants revenue is estimated to increase by $519 million or 2.4 per cent to $22.5 billion in 2011-12. This is largely due to an increase in specific purpose grants for on-passing and goods and services tax (GST) grants. In 2011-12 other revenue is expected to be $1.9 billion or $98 million (5.4 per cent) higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate. This is mainly due to increases in donations and gifts as well as fines.

Payroll   tax   Payroll tax is levied on taxable Victorian wages, defined to include salaries and wages, commissions, bonuses, taxable fringe benefits and payments to some contractors. Since July 2010, payroll tax of 4.9 per cent has been levied on businesses with a taxable total Australian wage bill above an annual tax-free threshold of $550 000. Around 33 000 businesses in Victoria pay payroll tax. Victorian businesses operating with annual payrolls valued between $5.5 million and $17.95 million pay the lowest payroll tax in Australia. Since 1 July 2007, Victoria and NSW have harmonised payroll tax legislation including common definitions and exemptions (excluding rates and thresholds), to streamline administration and reduce compliance costs for businesses. Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory have since joined with Victoria and NSW to harmonise their legislation, with other jurisdictions following with respect to eight main provisions of the law. As of April 2011, 37 joint Victorian and NSW revenue office revenue rulings have been published, most of which have now been adopted by other jurisdictions. The Payroll Tax Harmonisation Committee has been established by all the jurisdictions in Australia, to oversee the design, implementation and maintenance of an administrative framework. The Committee has established key protocols designed to assist revenue offices by articulating processes to ensure taxpayers who employ people across jurisdictions are dealt with consistently and without the need to repeat basic interactions with multiple offices. In 2011-12, payroll tax revenue is estimated to be $4.7 billion, an increase of $320 million (7.2 per cent) over the revised 2010-11 estimate. Both job advertisements and vacancies suggest a strong labour market with continuing increases in employment and wages. Taxes   on   property   Land   tax   Land tax is an annual tax assessed on the aggregated taxable value of all land in Victoria. Certain categories of land are exempt under the Land Tax Act 2005 . In 2011-12, exemptions for land used for charitable purposes, for primary production, and as the principal place of residence of the owner will be valued at more than $2 billion (see Chapter 5 Tax Expenditures and Concessions for more details). Land valuations are conducted biennially by local councils and the Valuer-General. Valuations made at 1 January 2010 will be used for both the 2011 and 2012 land tax years. Table 4.3 shows the land tax rates that are applicable for the 2012 land tax year (the 2011-12 budget year). Table   4.3:   2012   land   tax   rates (a)   General   land   tax   rates   Value   of   property   Land   tax   payable   $0 to $249 999  $250 000 to $599 999  $600 000 to $ 999 999  $1 000 000 to $1 799 999  $1 800 000 to $2 999 999  $3 000 000 and over  Nil  $275 plus 0.2% of the value in excess of $250 000  $975 plus 0.5% of the value in excess of $600 000  $2 975 plus 0.8% of the value in excess of $1 000 000  $9 375 plus 1.3% of the value in excess of $1 800 000  $24 975 plus 2.25% of the value in excess of $3 000 000  Trusts   land   tax   rates   (a)(b)   Value   of   property   Land   tax   payable   $0 to $24 999  $25 000 to $249 999  $250 000 to $599 999  $600 000 to $ 999 999  $1 000 000 to $1 799 999  $1 800 000 to $2 999 999  $3 000 000 and over  Nil  $82 plus 0.375% of the value in excess of $25 000  $926 plus 0.575% of the value in excess of $250 000  $2 938 plus 0.875% of the value in excess of $600 000  $6 438 plus 1.175% of the value in excess of $1 000 000  $15 838 plus 0.7614% of the value in excess of $1 800 000  $24 975 plus 2.25% of the value in excess of $3 000 000  Source: Land Tax Act 2005 Notes: (a) The 2012 land tax rates will apply in the 2012 assessment year, which is based upon property ownership as at midnight 31 December 2011. (b) Certain trusts are subject to a land tax surcharge of 0.375 per cent (on top of the ordinary land tax rates). The surcharge is phased out for site values between $1.8 million and $3 million to ensure that the rate on trusts is the same as standard land tax rates on land values above $3 million. Land tax revenue is expected to be $1.3 billion in 2011-12, slightly below the 2010-11 revised estimate of $1.4 billion. This decline reflects the impact of a small carryover of revenue into 2010-11, combined with the continued disaggregation of land holdings which incur a lower rate of tax. Congestion   levy   The Congestion levy is an annual charge on owners of long-stay off-street car parking spaces in Melbourne's central business district and adjacent areas such as Southbank, Docklands and the St Kilda Road precincts. The levy is subject to indexation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and for 2011 is $880 per car parking space. An exception is the area bounded by Montague Street, the West Gate Freeway, City Link and the Yarra River for which the levy is currently set at $400. The $400 rate will be reviewed pending the outcome of a review of parking requirements in planning schemes. Various car parking spaces are exempt from the levy, including short-stay parking spaces, parking spaces used exclusively for residential purposes, and certain other parking spaces such as those used by ambulances and charitable institutions. Congestion levy revenue in 2011-12 is expected to be $49.8 million, 2.8 per cent higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate, in line with the CPI indexation. Land   transfer   duty    Duty is payable on any transaction that results in a change of beneficial ownership of land and associated real assets. Properties bought as a principal place of residence attract a lower marginal rate for certain dutiable values. The current rates of conveyancing duty are shown in Table 4.4. Table   4.4:   Duty   on   land   transfers   General   land   transfer   duty   rates   Value   of   property   transferred   Duty   payable   Up to $25 000  $25 001 to $130 000  $130 001 to $960 000  $960 001 and over  1.4% of the value of the property  $350 plus 2.4% of the value in excess of $25 000  $2 870 plus 6% of the value in excess of $130 000  5.5% of the value of the property  Land   transfer   duty   rates   for   principal   place   of   residence   purchases   Value   of   property   transferred   Duty   payable   Up to $25 000  $25 001 to $130 000  $130 001 to $440 000  $440 001 to $550 000  $550 001 to $960 000  $960 001 and over  1.4% of the value of the property  $350 plus 2.4% of the value in excess of $25 000  $2 870 plus 5% of the value in excess of $130 000  $18 370 plus 6% of the value in excess of $440 000  $28 070 plus 6% of the value in excess of $550 000  5.5% of the value of the property  Source: Duties Act 2000 There is a land transfer duty exemption for homes transferred into special disability trusts in recognition of the particular nature of the arrangements for people with a severe disability. From 1 July 2011, eligible pensioners and concession card holders will receive a full duty concession on property valued up to $330 000, with a partial concession available for property worth up to $750 000. This concession will also become available to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. For contracts settled from 1 July 2011, eligible first homebuyers will begin to receive a series of discounts on land transfer duty. This initiative will reduce land transfer duty payable for first homebuyers purchasing principal places of residence valued up to $600 000. Table   4.5:   Discounts   on   land   transfer   duty       1   July   1   January 1   January 1   September     2011   2013 2014 2014   Land transfer duty cut    20%  10%   (30% cumulative) 10% (40% cumulative) 10%  (50% cumulative)  Source: Department of Treasury and Finance From 1 July 2011, farmers under the age of 35 buying their first farm property will receive a full land transfer duty exemption on purchases worth up to $300 000, while purchases worth up to $400 000 will receive some duty reduction. This initiative intends to address the issues of an ageing farm labour force and fewer young people entering the industry. Land transfer duty revenue is expected to decrease by $135 million or 3.5 per cent in 2011-12, reflecting the effects of new policy measures and the stabilisation of the property market. The combination of interest rate rises beginning in the second half of 2009, an easing in first home owner demand and concerns about affordability are expected to continue to depress volumes in 2011-12. However, the cooling of the residential market is offset partly by an upturn in the commercial and industrial property sectors. Landholder   duty   Victoria will reform land rich duty provisions in the Duties Act 2000 to introduce a simpler set of provisions known as the 'landholder duty' model. Currently, the purchase of a large share of a private company, private unit trust scheme or wholesale unit trust scheme, where more than 60 per cent of the assets are land, is subject to transfer duty as if the land were being purchased directly. This tax is known as 'land rich' duty. The landholder duty model will remove the incentive for the complex structures that have evolved in commercial transactions and bring Victoria into line with most of the other states and territories. The change to the landholder duty model will eliminate the need for complex valuations and calculations in relation to the proportion of assets represented by land. The Government will consult with industry ahead of the introduction of the new provisions to commence on 1 July 2012. This change is expected to raise revenue of approximately $50 million to $75 million a year from 2012-13. Other   property   duties   This category includes revenue from minor duties such as duty on declarations of trust over properties other than land, which is currently set at $200, and duty on the sale of certain livestock with revenue directed to a trust fund relating to disease control. This revenue also includes any minor adjustments relating to property taxes that have been abolished in recent years. Revenue from other property duties is estimated to be 2.9 per cent higher in 2011-12 than the revised 2010-11 estimate, in line with CPI indexation. Metropolitan   improvement   levy   The Metropolitan improvement levy is charged on all properties in the metropolitan area and is provided to the Department of Sustainability and Environment for the management of metropolitan parks, open spaces and waterways. The rate is determined taking into consideration the amount expected to be disbursed from the Parks and Reserves Trust Account for these purposes. Revenue in 2011-12 is estimated to be $130 million or $4.4 million (3.5 per cent) higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate due to both annual indexation of the levy and an increase in the number of properties in the metropolitan area. Property   owner   contributions   to   fire   brigades   Municipal councils wholly or partly within the metropolitan area serviced by the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board are collectively required by legislation to contribute 12.5 per cent of the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board's approved annual budget. Revenue in 2011-12 is expected to be $31 million, $2.9 million higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate. Financial   accommodation   levy   The financial accommodation levy (FAL) applies to government-owned entities declared to be leviable authorities under the Financial Management Act 1994. The purpose of the levy is to remove the market advantage that government entities may otherwise experience in borrowing, by virtue of their sovereign status, thereby ensuring that borrowings are valued appropriately in decisions on the financing of capital projects. Revenue from the FAL is expected to be $90 million in 2011-12, which is $19 million (26 per cent) higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate of $71 million. This increase is mainly due to the expected increase in borrowings by water corporations to fund capital projects. Growth   Areas   Infrastructure   Contribution The Growth Areas Infrastructure Contribution (GAIC) scheme commenced on 1 July 2010. It will partly fund the provision of infrastructure in growth areas and enable more timely provision of facilities and services. The GAIC applies to land brought into the Urban Growth Boundary in recent years that are zoned for urban development. Monies received from the GAIC will be allocated into two funds, the Growth Areas Public Transport Fund and the Building New Communities Fund, which will support the provision of public transport and community infrastructure in the new growth areas. Revenue from the GAIC is expected to be $36 million in 2011-12, which is 33.6 per cent higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate of $27 million. Gambling   taxes   Gambling taxes are imposed on public lotteries, electronic gaming machines (EGMs), the Crown Casino, racing, and some other forms of gambling. The taxes are typically in the form of a percentage of net expenditure, with the tax rate varying according to the category of gambling. Net expenditure is equal to the amount gambled less prizes or refunds to players. In the case of EGMs, there is also an annual health benefit levy of $4 333 per machine in operation. Gambling tax figures also reflect revenue associated with the gaming and Keno licence premiums. Most gambling tax revenue is transferred by standing appropriation to the Hospitals and Charities Fund, the Mental Health Fund or the Community Support Fund. In 2011-12, it is estimated that 82 per cent ($1.4 billion) of total gambling taxation revenue will be transferred by standing appropriation to these funds. Overall, gambling taxes are expected to increase by $76 million (4.6 per cent) in 2011-12, compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate. As mentioned above, this is in line with household consumption expenditure growth and the impact of changes to the Casino's licence conditions. To enable the Victorian wagering licensee to compete effectively with interstate operators, a concessional tax rate applies to commissions attributable to premium customers (i.e. those customers who invest more than $3 million in Victorian totalisators conducted by the licensee in a financial year). The concession was introduced by the Gambling Regulation (Premium Customer) Regulations 2011 and made under sections 4.6.3(6) and 11.2.1 of the Gambling Regulation Act 2003 . A new regulatory model will apply to the post-2012 gambling licences, with new licences applying to EGMs, Keno and wagering. There will also be a newly created monitoring licence. EGMs will transition from the current gaming operator duopoly to a system where venue operators are licensed to own and operate gaming machines in their own right. The new 10-year EGM entitlements were allocated via a pre-auction club offer and a competitive gaming auction in 2010 and will commence on 16 August 2012. A new 10-year Keno licence was awarded on 25 March 2011 and will commence on 15 April 2012. The licences for wagering activities and monitoring, the allocation of which is still being determined, will commence in August 2012. From August 2012, the tax applying to wagering will be reduced to support the post-2012 licensing arrangements and provide the Victorian racing industry with additional funding from wagering. The Government will also introduce a new progressive tax system for EGMs post-2012 applying to each venue's average monthly net expenditure per gaming machine. Levies   on   statutory   corporations   Water corporations are required to pay an annual environmental contribution to fund water related initiatives that seek to promote the sustainable management of water, and to address adverse environmental impacts associated with water use. The environmental contribution levy is estimated to raise $286 million between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2012. A decision on whether to continue the environmental contribution levy beyond 1 July 2012 has yet to be made. Taxes   on   insurance   Non \u2010 life   insurance   Duty is payable on the gross value of premiums on general insurance business at a rate of 10 per cent. General insurance is insurance that is applicable to property in Victoria or a risk, contingency or event that may occur within, or partly in, Victoria including damage to motor vehicles and insurance against loss of home or contents. The definition of general insurance includes insurance in respect of trauma and disabilities but excludes health insurance, life Exemptions from payment of this duty relate to policies against damage by hail to cereal and fruit crops, workers' compensation premiums, commercial marine hull insurance, private guarantee fidelity insurance schemes, insurance businesses carried on by organisations registered under Part VI of the Commonwealth National Health Act 1953 and transport insurance policies. Reinsurance policies are not subject to duty. Non-life insurance revenue is expected to increase by $61 million (8 per cent) in 2011-12 compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate. The increase in non-life insurance reflects higher domestic insurance (both domestic and commercial premium rates are higher). This is on account of rising global risks from natural disasters and higher volume due to growth in the economy. Life   insurance   Life insurance is any insurance or assurance in respect of life or lives, or an event or contingency relating to or depending on a life or lives, of persons living in Victoria. Temporary or term life insurance is taxed once at a 5 per cent rate when the policy starts. For whole-of-life insurance, duty is payable on the sum insured. Life insurance revenue is expected to rise by $0.2 million (2.8 per cent) in 2011-12 compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate, which is broadly in line with the expected growth in the economy. Duty   on   compulsory   third   party   premiums   Duty is payable on the value of compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance premiums at a rate of 10 per cent. Compulsory third party premium duty revenue is expected to increase by $6.4 million (4.3 per cent) in 2011-12 compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate. This reflects an anticipated rise in the volume of motor vehicle registrations, as well as indexation with the CPI . Insurance   contributions   to   fire   brigades    Victoria partly funds fire services through an insurance based funding model. Insurance companies generally choose to recover their contributions through an insurance industry fire services levy imposed on premiums. The level of required contributions by insurance companies to the approved annual budget of the Victorian fire services is prescribed under Section 37 of the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Act 1958 (75 per cent) and Section 76 of the Country Fire Authority Act 1958 (77.5 per cent). The legislation also prescribes that non residential property owners who choose to either self insure or insure off shore, are required to pay a contribution to whichever fire service covers the area in which their property is located. In 2011-12, revenue from insurance contributions to fire services is anticipated to increase by $88 million (15.8 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimate. This is driven by investment in the State's Fire and Emergency Services as part of the 2011-12 Budget and incremental implementation of recommendations form the 2009 Victoria's Bushfires Royal Commission final report. Motor   vehicle   taxes   Vehicle   registration   fees   Motor vehicle registration fees are fees charged when a vehicle is registered and vary according to vehicle type and use of the vehicle. Pensioner and health care card holders receive a 50 per cent concession on their motor vehicle registration fee while Department of Veteran's Affairs gold card holders receive free motor vehicle registration. Duty   on   vehicle   registrations   and   transfers   Duty is levied on the transfer and registration of motor vehicles, motorcycles and trailers in Victoria. The duty is levied on the market value or purchase price (whichever is greater) of the vehicle, at a progressive rate on new passenger cars, and at a flat rate for other vehicles. Victoria currently has the lowest stamp duty of the major states on new, conventionally powered passenger cars valued up to $57 466, which includes the most common Australian-made family cars. The rate scale is shown in Table 4.6. Table   4.6:   Motor   vehicle   duty   rate   Market   value   of   vehicle   Duty   payable   For motor vehicles not previously registered:  Passenger cars (a)  $0 to $57 466  $57 467 or more  Other vehicles  All values  For motor vehicles previously registered,  regardless of location:  All values        $5 per $200 or part thereof on entire price  $10 per $200 or part thereof on entire price    $5 per $200 or part thereof on entire price     $8 per $200 or part thereof on entire price  Source : Duties Act 2000 and Department of Treasury and Finance (a) This threshold is indexed to the Commonwealth Luxury Car Tax Threshold, which may increase on 1 July 2011. Aggregate motor vehicle taxation revenue in 2011-12 is expected to grow by $57 million (3.7 per cent) compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate. Of this, registration fee revenue is forecast to increase by $43 million (4.7 per cent) in 2011-12, due to the increasing stock of cars and motorcycles registered and annual indexation of registration fees in line with the CPI. Revenue from duty on motor vehicle registrations and transfers is expected to increase by $13 million (2.2 per cent) in 2011-12 compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate driven by strong sales, arising from improved affordability. Other   taxes   Other tax revenue includes the landfill levy, concession fees paid in advance by Transurban with respect to Melbourne CityLink and Liquor licence fees. Revenue from these sources is expected to increase by 26.1 per cent to $182 million in 2011-12. In the 2011-12 Budget , landfill revenue is expected to increase by 38.5 per cent in 2011-12 to $132 million as progressive increases in the landfill levy rate have been brought forward by one year. These increases provide incentives to reduce the level of waste and foster best practice in waste management. Interest   revenue    Interest revenue is estimated to be $576 million in 2011-12. This will be $211 million or 57.7 per cent higher than the 2010-11 revised estimates, primarily reflecting the interest payment associated with the finance lease arrangement for the Victorian desalination plant. Dividends,   income   tax   and   rate   equivalent   revenue    This category of revenue comprises dividends, income tax and rate equivalent revenue received by the State from government business enterprises and other sources as detailed in Table 4.7. Table   4.7:   Dividends,   income   tax   and   rate   equivalent   revenue   ($   million)      2009 \u2010 10 2010 \u2010 11 2011 \u2010 12   Change      Actual Revised Budget   %   (a)   Dividends   309.1  236.0  415.6  76.1  Income tax equivalent revenue   171.9  166.8  153.7  (7.8)  Local government rate equivalent revenue   4.6  5.2  5.6  7.7  Total   dividends,   income   tax   and   rate   equivalent   revenue     485.6   408.0   574.9   40.9   Source: Department of Treasury and Finance Note: (a) Per cent change between 2010-11 and 2011-12. Dividend, income tax and rate equivalent revenue is expected to be $575 million in 2011-12, which is $167 million (40.9 per cent) higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate, mainly driven by higher dividend revenue. Total dividend revenue is expected to increase by $180 million (76.1 per cent) in 2011-12. This is largely due to the deferral of the 2010-11 interim dividends from the metropolitan water businesses into 2011-12. There is potential for the profitability of the metropolitan water businesses for 2010-11 to vary materially from the businesses' forecasts due to a range of factors including climatic conditions (which impact on water usage) and residential land development activity. It is proposed that a single dividend be payable by the metropolitan water businesses in October 2011 in respect of 2010-11, and in light of their full year results. Total income tax equivalent revenue is expected to decrease by $13 million (7.8 per cent) in 2011-12 as compared with the 2010-11 revised estimate. This is mainly a result of lower forecast taxable income for Port of Melbourne Corporation, City West Water Limited and Melbourne Water Corporation. Sales   of   goods   and   services Revenue from sales of goods and services is estimated to be $6.5 billion in 2011-12, an increase of 8.3 per cent or $496 million on the 2010-11 revised estimate. Factors contributing to this change include: \u2022 the one-off impact of payments from Melbourne Water Corporation which were previously recognised as revenue in 2009-10 and 2010-11 and will now be recognised as revenue in 2011-12 when the desalination plant is commissioned, consistent with the accounting treatment in the 2009-10 Financial Report ; and \u2022 an increase in inter-sector capital asset charge revenue from VicTrack reflecting increased VicTrack asset values due to additional capital expenditure. Note 4 of the Estimated Financial Statements, Budget Paper No. 5 Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes , provides a breakdown of sales of goods and services by major category. Other   revenue   Other revenue includes the fair value of assets received free of charge, fines, royalties, donations and gifts and other miscellaneous income. These are shown in Table 4.8.

(b) Reduced revenue from 2009-10 to 2010-11 is due to the reconciliation of administration fees associated with the issue of late fines from Other revenue to the sales of goods and services. In 2011-12 other revenue is expected to be $1.9 billion, or $98 million higher than the 2010-11 revised estimate. This is mainly due to increases in donations and gifts as well as fines and other miscellaneous revenue. Donations and gifts are expected to increase by $54 million (22.2 per cent) to $298 million in 2011-12, predominantly due to increased contributions for the new Royal Children's Hospital. Fines revenue is expected to increase by $24 million or 4.5 per cent to $545 million in 2011-12 compared to 2010-11 revised budget. This is mainly due to the impact of CPI indexation. Traffic camera and on the spot fines are expected to increase in line with the impact of indexation and increased patronage."

Total grants are expected to increase by $519 million or 2.4 per cent between 2011-12 and 2010-11 revised estimate. This largely reflects comparable increases in general purpose grants (GST) and specific purpose grants for on-passing of $291 million and $212 million respectively. The increase in GST grants is driven by a higher national GST pool in 2011-12 compared to 2010-11. The current estimate for 2011-12 GST grants has been revised down by $811 million since 2010-11 Budget Update (as described below). The increase in specific purpose grants for on-passing is mainly driven by grants for non-government schools under the National Education Agreement and financial assistance grants to local governments."

The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreement of 11 February 2011 on National Health Reform removed the prospective requirement, agreed in April 2010, for a portion of GST grants to be dedicated to the provision of health care services. Compared to previous forecasts GST has been revised down by $4.1 billion over five years, comprising of a $2.5 billion reduction in GST relativities and a $1.6 billion reduction from changes to the pool (as described below)."

Victoria supports an appropriate system of HFE that takes account of the challenges faced by smaller jurisdictions in providing services. Every year the CGC updates its recommended GST relativities consistent with the terms of reference handed down by the Commonwealth Treasurer. The CGC's 2011 Update recommends a reduction in Victoria's GST share to 22.5 per cent of the total GST pool in 2011-12. This compares with a relativity of 23.4 per cent in 2010-11 and a population share of approximately 25 per cent. As a result, Victoria will lose $498 million in GST grants in 2011-12 and $2.5 billion over the forward estimates. Victoria has significant concerns with the latest CGC recommendations. The redistribution is very substantial, creates a shock to Victoria's budget position and undermines the principle of HFE. An appropriate system of HFE should promote good public policy, not penalise states which deliver much needed reform to areas of government service delivery, and should produce stable and predictable outcomes."

Better   TAFE   Facilities   Funding is provided as part of the Commonwealth Government's National Building - Economic Stimulus Plan (Better TAFE Facilities). Funding provides support to assist TAFE institutes to address immediate maintenance needs, small capital works and the purchase of plant and equipment with a focus on modernising and improving the quality of teaching and learning across the TAFE sector. The Commonwealth's economic stimulus package was designed to increase immediate spending in the economy from 2009-10 year, with a subsequent winding down of the package as projects are completed. Caring   for   Our   Country    Caring for our Country is the way the Commonwealth Government funds environmental management of natural resources. Caring for our Country helps communities, farmers and other land managers protect the natural environment. Funding of $27.5 million is expected to be provided to Victoria in 2011-12 for base funding to Catchment Management Authorities, with a further $1.6 million expected under the competitive component.

Early   childhood   education   Funding is provided to assist Victoria to work towards the COAG's target of access to 15 hours of early childhood education a week for all children in the year before school by 2013. In 2011-12, grants for early childhood education are estimated to be $59 million, an increase of $40 million (206.2 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimates of $19 million, which is due to an additional step-up funding to achieve the 2013 targets. Elective   Surgery   Waiting   List   Reduction   Program   Funding is provided to increase physical capacity and elective surgery throughput by redeveloping facilities, purchasing surgical equipment and technology and developing innovation initiatives.

This is a result of concluding the first phase of the program of achieving a 1:1 ratio of student to computer by 31 December 2011, and moving into the next phase where funding is provided to replace the additional computers purchased through the Fund. National   Solar   Schools   Plan   The National Solar Schools Program offers grants to install solar and other renewable power systems, solar hot water systems, rainwater tanks and a range of energy efficiency measures. Natural   Disaster   Relief   The Natural Disaster Relief grant applies to the natural disasters declared in Victoria. The expected increase in grants in 2011-12 is driven by an increase in claims following recent extreme weather conditions, particularly bushfires and floods. Plan   for   Perinatal   Depression   Funding is provided to improve prevention and early detection of antenatal and postnatal depression and provide better support and treatment for expectant and new mothers experiencing depression. Preventive   Health   Funding is provided for the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH) to address the rising prevalence of lifestyle-related chronic diseases by reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, increasing physical activity in children and adults, and reducing tobacco and alcohol use in adults. The NPAPH aims to promote healthy behaviours by working with pre-schools, schools, workplaces and communities (supported by social marketing activities). As part of the NPAPH, Victoria is required to develop implementation plans for Healthy Workers, Healthy Children and Social Marketing - Measure Up. Productivity   Places   Program   The Productivity Places Program provides for Victoria and the Commonwealth Government to work together to increase the number of people with skills and trades qualifications, as well as the number of people with higher level qualifications. In 2011-12, grants for the Productivity Places Program are estimated to be $120 million, an increase of $15 million (14.1 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimates of $105 million, which is due to the forecast number of places to be funded. Regional   Rail   Link   In May 2009, the Commonwealth Government announced a contribution of $3.2 billion to the Regional Rail Link project to be provided over six years from 2008-09 to 2013-14. The project will construct a dual track link of up to 50 kilometres from West Werribee to central Melbourne's Southern Cross Station, via Sunshine. This includes construction of a new rail line from Werribee to Deer Park, new stations at Tarneit and Wyndham Vale, and duplication of existing tracks between Sunshine and Kensington. The project will deliver capacity for an extra 9 000 regional and suburban passengers every hour and will allow regional rail services to run express into Melbourne, increasing transport capacity and reliability for Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. The Commonwealth has announced that $500 million of its contribution will be deferred until the 2015-16 year, beyond the forward estimates. Remote   Indigenous   housing   Funding is provided through the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for Indigenous community housing organisations' properties from the Commonwealth to Victoria. Seamless   National   Economy   On 29 November 2008, COAG signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy) , aimed at delivering more consistent regulation across jurisdictions. The agreement includes the 27 deregulation priorities agreed by COAG in March 2008, the eight priority areas for competition reform agreed by COAG in July 2008, and regulatory reform that continues to develop and enhance existing processes for regulation making and review to increase the efficiency of regulation. Under the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy , Victoria will be eligible for $50 million in reward payments from the Commonwealth in 2011-12. This will follow an assessment process set out under the National Partnership Agreement that involves the COAG Reform Council advising the Commonwealth on the achievement of key milestones, as set out in the Implementation Plan, for the 27 deregulation priorities covered by this reform. Statewide   enhancements   to   regional   cancer   services   Funding is provided to undertake statewide enhancements to existing regional cancer services in Victoria, to benefit areas including Bendigo, Traralgon and Albury-Wodonga. TAFE   fee   waivers   for   childcare   qualifications   Funding is provided to develop a child care workforce with high level qualifications to provide a strong foundation for the health and educational development of children, by ensuring that TAFE and other government providers do not levy compulsory regulated fees on students undertaking eligible child care qualifications. Teacher   quality   Funding is provided for measures to improve and maintain the quality of the teaching workforce. Non-government schools also participate in this National Partnership on Improving Teacher Quality. In 2011-12, grants for teacher quality are estimated to be $55 million, an increase of $46 million (538.4 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimate of $8.6 million. The increase in funding captures eligible payments that the State could potentially receive. Trade   training   centres   in   schools   Funding is provided to build new or upgrade existing, trade or vocational education and training facilities. In 2011-12, grants for trade training centres in schools are estimated to be $37 million, a decrease of $9 million (19.5 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimates of $46 million. This is due to additional funding being received in 2009-10 for this initiative as part of the Commonwealth's economic stimulus package, which was designed to increase immediate spending in 2009-10, resulting in a drop in funding in subsequent years as the projects reach completion. Victorian   Comprehensive   Cancer   Centre   Funding is provided to develop the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre . The Centre will drive leadership and innovation in the fields of cancer treatment, research and education by having the largest concentration of cancer clinicians and researchers in the southern hemisphere, ranking it among the top 10 cancer centres in the world. The Commonwealth has recently advised that $50 million of its contribution will be deferred beyond the forward estimates. Victorian   Cytology   Service   Funding is provided to the Victorian Cytology Service to report on cervical cytology tests. It is the largest single laboratory reporting Pap tests in Australia, examining approximately 300 000 Pap smears a year, which represents just over half of the smears taken annually in Victoria. The Victorian Cytology Service aims to prevent the morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer among Victorian women by functioning as a national centre of excellence in the accurate and cost-effective reporting of cytology specimens. Victorian   Legal   Aid   The National Partnership Agreement on Legal Aid provides funding for a share of the service delivery costs of Victoria Legal Aid on Commonwealth law matters."

This resulted in an increase in revenue received in 2010-11. Under Water for the Future, the Commonwealth is estimated to contribute to a number of Victorian projects in 2011-12, including the Barwon Water - Shell Recycling Plant, the Black Rock water recycling project, the National Groundwater Action Plan and enhancements to Victoria's water registry systems. Youth   Attainment   and   Transitions   This initiative provides funding to increase participation of young people in education and training, increase attainment levels, and improve successful transition from schools. In 2011-12, grants for the youth attainment and transition are estimated to be $29 million, an increase of $12 million (72.8 per cent) compared to the 2010-11 revised estimates of $17 million.

They include tax-free thresholds and can also take the form of exempting or applying a lower rate, deductions or rebate of a tax for a certain class of taxpayer, activity or asset (this excludes generally applying marginal tax rates). Table 5.1 shows aggregate tax expenditure estimates excluding the effect of tax-free thresholds for land tax and payroll tax by the main categories of tax for the period 2010-11 to 2014-15. Tax expenditures are expected to increase by $488 million over this period, reflecting the growth in property prices and the economy more generally. In particular, land tax expenditures are expected to grow in line with the land tax revenue profile, while estimates of payroll tax expenditures are anticipated to increase moderately, reflecting expected employment and wages growth. The slight fall in land tax expenditures forecast in 2011-12 reflects the small ongoing disaggregation in land holdings, as well as a small carryover in revenue from 2009-10 to 2010-11.

The total value of tax assistance provided by the Government is estimated at $5.7 billion in 2011-12, increasing to $6.2 billion by 2014-15 driven mainly by estimated increases in land tax expenditures. Other land transfer duties includes two new concessions for first homebuyers of properties valued up to $600 000 and for farmers under 35 years of age purchasing their first farms.

Table 5.4 provides a grouping of estimated tax expenditures to particular persons or entities based on the legal incidence of state taxes. In 2010-11 there was a significant one-off increase in tax expenditures for businesses relating to stamp duty relief for corporate reconstruction, due to a small number of high-value business asset transfers. This is expected to return to historic levels from 2011-12 and is driving the forecast decline in aggregate expenditures for 2011-12.

Certain characteristics of the consumer, such as possession of a Commonwealth pension card or a health care card, are the basis for entitlement. Concessions allow certain groups in the community to access and/or purchase important amenities such as energy, health and transportation at a cheaper rate or free of charge. Chart 5.1 shows the estimated distribution of concessions by category for 2010-11. At an aggregate level, the majority of concessions are concentrated in health (ambulance, dental and spectacles and community health programs) accounting for 42.7 per cent of total concessions. The current year has seen a marked increase in the relative importance of energy, municipal rates, water and sewerage concessions, the next largest category. This is due to 2011-12 Budget initiatives to increase the electricity discount for certain groups of Victorians and the water and sewerage concession from 2011. These concessions accounted for 28.3 per cent of total concessions in 2010-11, compared with 24.1 per cent in 2009-10. The third largest category is combined public and private transport, accounting for 20.2 per cent of total concessions.

(c) Municipal rates concessions for 2010-11 includes a non-recurrent adjustment relating to 2009-10 of $9.7 million. The energy, municipal rates, water and sewerage category consists of concessions for electricity and gas usage, municipal rates, water and sewerage charges. Health concessions include free emergency ambulance transport for concession holders, as well as community and dental services and optical concessions. Health also includes community health programs. Education concessions include the education maintenance allowance, concessions for preschool, and from 2011-12, concessions for Vocational Education and Training and payments for the School Start Bonus. The School Start Bonus will be means tested from 2011-12 to ensure that it is better targeted to provide assistance to those families most in need. The social and community services category include concessions for non-profit organisations such as the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Buying Service, Victorian Council of Social Service, Community Information Victoria, Bereavement Assistance Limited, the Charity Freight Service and the VicRelief Foodbank.

Under the terms of this deed, the State will upgrade the Monash and West Gate Freeways, while CML will upgrade the Southern Link section of CityLink. The State will become entitled to 50 per cent of the additional CityLink revenue created by the Monash CityLink West Gate upgrade after CML recovers its construction and additional operating costs relating to works on the Southern Link. The method used to calculate the additional CityLink revenue generated from the upgrade will be based on comparing actual CityLink revenue with agreed trends. The calculation of the additional City Link revenue will take place on 30 June 2014."

                    "text": "A number of potential obligations, which are non-quantifiable at this time, have been recognised arising from: \u2022 indemnities provided in relation to transactions, including financial arrangements and consultancy services, as well as for directors and administrators; \u2022 performance guarantees, warranties, letters of comfort and the like; \u2022 deeds in respect of certain obligations; and \u2022 unclaimed monies, which may be subject to future claims by the general public against the State. An overview of the more significant non-quantifiable liabilities follows. Asset   sales   Potential exposures are associated with the sale of a number of assets and services where the purchaser was provided with various indemnities and warranties. Royal   Melbourne   Showgrounds   redevelopment   The State, through the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV), formed an unincorporated joint venture for the purposes of redeveloping the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds (the Showgrounds), with the State and the RASV each holding a 50 per cent interest in the joint venture. The joint venture participants then established an incorporated entity, Showgrounds Nominees Pty Ltd, to enter into contractual arrangements with the private sector party. The project, a public private partnership, involves a private sector consortium (concessionaire), which was responsible for the design, construction and financing of the redevelopment of the Showgrounds and continues to be responsible for maintaining and providing facility management services at the Showgrounds for a period of 25 years from August 2006. Under the contract, the State supports the underlying payment obligations of the joint venture participants for Showgrounds Nominees Pty Ltd to meet its obligations to pay the service fee to the concessionaire. Any actual financial support provided by the State on behalf of the RASV under the contract will be treated as a loan, which will be repaid by the RASV by the end of the 25 year contract term. Repayment by the RASV may take the form of the transfer to the State of part or whole of the RASV's participating interest in the joint venture. Separately and similarly, under another agreement between the State and RASV, the State supports certain obligations of the RASV that may arise out of a suite of joint venture agreements between the State and the RASV, or between the joint venture and a third party. In accordance with this agreement, the State will meet certain RASV obligations in the form of a loan, up to a maximum of $20 million, if requested by the RASV when the RASV does not have the financial capacity to pay. RASV must repay any such loan by the end of the 25 year term and this repayment may take the form of a transfer to the State, of the whole or part, of the RASV participating interest in the joint venture. National   Electricity   Code   Administrator   As part of the wind-up of the National Electricity Code Administrator (NECA), the State has undertaken to indemnify the actions of the NECA directors for a period of seven years on completion of their tenure in 2015. Australian   Energy   Market   Operator   Ltd   In order for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) to participate in the national electricity market administered by Australian Energy Market Operator Ltd (AEMO), a guarantee must be provided to AEMO by an acceptable financial institution. The Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV) has provided such a guarantee whereby it undertakes to pay AEMO on demand any and all amounts to an aggregate amount not exceeding $147.4 million as security for the obligations of SECV to AEMO. The guarantee is issued pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Treasury Corporation of Victoria Act 1992 and is approved by the Treasurer. The guarantee is fully supported by an indemnity from SECV and by non-withdrawable deposits which SECV is obliged to maintain with TCV at an amount of 101 per cent of the amount guaranteed. Public   transport   rail   partnership   agreements   The Director of Public Transport (the Director), on behalf of the Crown, entered into partnership contractual arrangements with franchisees to operate metropolitan rail transport services in the State, operative from 30 November 2009 until 30 November 2017. The major contingent liabilities arising from those arrangements in the event of early termination or expiry of the partnership agreement are: \u2022 franchise assets: to maintain continuity of services, the assets, at early termination or expiry of the franchise agreement, will revert to the Director or a successor. In the case of some assets, a reversion back to the Director would entail those assets as being purchased; and \u2022 unfunded superannuation: at the early termination or expiry of the contract, the Director will assume any unfunded superannuation amounts (apart from contributions the franchisee is required to pay over the contract term) to the extent that the State becomes the successor operator. OneLink   Transit   Systems   performance   bonus   The State recognises a contingent liability relating to the performance bonus component of the contract with OneLink Transit Systems. At this time, it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of potential performance bonus payments as this will be impacted by variables such as patronage growth, equipment performance and vandalism. The uncertainty of these variables will also be impacted by the extent to which the current maintenance program can support the reliability of equipment which is nearing the end of its design life. Kamco   performance   related   payments   The New Ticketing Solution Project Agreement provides a mechanism through which Kamco (Keane Australia Micropayments Consortium Pty Ltd) can claim performance related bonuses. In the event of any such claims, the State will ensure it maintains all its rights under the current contract with regard to performance. Intermodal   freight   terminal   The Department of Transport is defending, on behalf of the State, a claim for damages relating to the development and management of an intermodal freight terminal in Gippsland in which the plaintiff is seeking damages of $44.7 million. The information usually required by AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets is not disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of the litigation. Native   Title   A number of claims have been filed with the Federal Court under the Commonwealth Native Title Act of 1993 that affect Victoria. It is not feasible at this time to quantify any future liability. Department   of   Education   and   Early   Childhood   Development   Indemnities are provided by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) to: \u2022 the Commonwealth in various funding contracts entered with the State throughout the year. Each indemnity is limited to $10 million for personal injuries and property damage, and $50 million for damages arising from internet usage; \u2022 teachers, volunteer workers and school chaplains. The specific indemnity in respect to teachers is only in relation to negligence claims by students, provided the teacher was not intoxicated, or engaged in a criminal offence, or engaged in outrageous conduct, and was incurred in the course of the teacher's employment. Indemnities are also provided to teachers, as well as all other departmental employees, in accordance with the Government policy and guidelines: indemnities and immunities, June 2008; and \u2022 members of school councils. The Education and Training Reform Act 2006 provides a comprehensive indemnity to members of school councils for any legal liability, whether in contract, negligence and defamation, etc. Contingent   liabilities   for   employment   related   legal   proceedings   Under the Victorian Public Service (VPS) Agreement, relevant departments and agencies have an obligation to indemnify VPS employees in relation to the costs of employment related legal proceedings that may arise from the performance of the duties of employees. The   Biosciences   Research   Centre   The Biosciences Research Centre (BRC) project is a joint initiative between the State, through the Department of Primary Industries (DPI), and La Trobe University (La Trobe). The project is being delivered as a public private partnership. DPI and La Trobe have formed an unincorporated joint venture for the purposes of undertaking the BRC project. The State holds 75 per cent participating interest and La Trobe holds 25 per cent participating interest in the joint venture. The facility that is being constructed will be known as AgriBio, Centre for AgriBioscience. The project involves a partnership between the joint venture and the private sector consortium, Plenary Research Pty Ltd (concessionaire), which is responsible for the design, construction, commissioning and financing of AgriBio and the provision of contracted services required for the maintenance and operation of the facility. The joint venture participants established an incorporated entity known as Biosciences Research Centre Pty Ltd for the purposes of entering into the contractual arrangements with the concessionaire. Construction of AgriBio commenced in May 2009, and the new facility is expected to be commissioned in late 2011 and fully operational in 2012. Under the contract, the service fee payment obligations of Biosciences Research Centre Pty Ltd (on behalf of the joint venture participants) are supported by the State of Victoria. In accordance with the contract, the State supports the underlying payment obligations of the joint venture participants, including La Trobe, to the joint venture company, thereby enabling the joint venture company to meet its obligations to pay the service fee to the concessionaire pursuant to the contract. Any financial support provided by the State to La Trobe under the contract will be treated as a loan to be repaid by La Trobe by the end of the 25-year contract term. Repayment by La Trobe may take the form of the transfer to the State of part or all of La Trobe's participating interest in the joint venture. Royal   Children's   Hospital   The Royal Children's Hospital Foundation (RCHF) has entered into a funding agreement with the Commonwealth Government for the provision of $21 million to undertake the Australian Early Development Index Project. RCHF has entered into this agreement at the request of the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH). In consideration of RCHF entering into the funding agreement, RCH has agreed to be responsible for the obligations and liabilities imposed on RCHF under the funding agreement, including, but not limited to, the indemnity granted by RCHF to the Commonwealth of Australia under clause 19 of the funding agreement. HIH   Insurance   The State's quantifiable direct exposures arising from the collapse of the HIH Insurance Group (HIH) are included in the liabilities shown in the financial statements of the entities directly responsible for them. The State's obligations in respect of its builders' warranty insurance rescue package are also shown as direct liabilities of the relevant government entities. The State also retains some unquantifiable contingent exposures arising from the collapse. These contingent exposures arise primarily through the possibility that the State may be involved in litigation in which it would be entitled to recover damages from third parties. If these third parties were insured by HIH, recovery in full may not be possible. Land   remediation   -   environmental   concerns   In addition to properties for which remediation costs have been provided in these financial statements, certain other properties have been identified as potentially contaminated sites. The State does not admit any liability in respect of these sites. However, remedial expenditure may be incurred to restore the sites to an acceptable environmental standard in the event of future developments taking place. Victorian   Managed   Insurance   Authority   -   insurance   cover   The Victorian Managed Insurance Authority (VMIA) was established in 1996 as an insurer for departments and participating bodies (predominantly in the general government sector). VMIA provides its client bodies with a range of insurance cover, including for property, public and products liability, professional indemnity and contract works. VMIA reinsures in the private market for losses above $50 million arising out of any one event, up to a maximum of $750 million for public liability, and for losses above $50 million arising out of any one event, up to a maximum of $2.1 billion for property. The risk of losses above these reinsured levels is borne by the State. VMIA also insures the Department of Health for all public sector medical indemnity claims incurred in each policy year from 1 July 2003, regardless of when the claims are finally settled. Under the Indemnity Deed to provide Stop Loss protection for VMIA, the Department of Treasury and Finance has agreed to reimburse VMIA if the ultimate claims payouts exceed by more than 20 per cent the initial estimate on which the risk premium was based. Since 31 March 2010, pursuant to a ministerial direction under Section 25A of the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority Act 1996 , VMIA has underwritten domestic building insurance. Domestic   building   insurance   In mid-April 2002, the State agreed to provide temporary (to 30 June 2002) reinsurance support to domestic building insurance provider Dexta Corporation following the withdrawal of some of its commercial reinsurance support. While this support was subsequently extended to policies issued before 30 September 2002, the former Government determined there would be no further extension. The State received reinsurance premiums for this participation and may be required to contribute to payment of reinsured claims, as well as paying management fees. The precise timing and value of these receipts and payments is uncertain, as claims may be made by home owners for up to six and a half years after the arrangement ceases. These claims may also take an additional several years to be processed through the legal system. Receipts and payments will be contingent on the volume of insurance underwritten and reinsured by 30 September 2002. Based on Dexta's previous levels of activity, the central estimate of the State's gross exposure (i.e. before premium receipts) is not more than $6 million. While the State expects, like the commercial reinsurers who are party to the agreement, to at least break even on these arrangements, the State retains an unquantifiable contingent liability that claims may exceed the central estimate. On 13 March 2002, Victoria and New South Wales jointly announced a series of reforms to domestic building insurance arrangements. This announcement included a commitment to provide a catastrophe fund capable of supporting claims above $10 million. To meet this commitment, the two states offered reinsurance arrangements to all builders' warranty insurers covering claims in respect of any one builder in excess of $10 million, with each state reinsuring claims relating to properties in that state. South Australia has since also become involved in these arrangements. Since domestic building insurance commenced, there have been no losses by an insurer to any one builder that exceed this amount. Victoria has reinsurance agreements giving effect to these arrangements with three insurers. The agreements require the insurers to pay the reinsurance premiums to Victoria (and to any other state that is also a party to such an agreement), in respect of new insurance policies written that are estimated to be sufficient for the State to at least break even on these arrangements. However, the State retains an unquantifiable contingent liability for additional claims. Gambling   licences   In 1992, a gaming operator's licence was issued to the Trustees of the Will and Estate of the late George Adams, now trading as Tatts Group. In 1994, the State issued a wagering and gaming licence to TABCORP Holdings Limited (TABCORP). These licences expire in 2012. The Gambling Regulation Act 2003 specifies end of licence arrangements which include compensation provisions for the licensees predicated on the current licensing arrangements being rolled over for a further period beyond 2012. On 10 April 2008, the former government announced a new regulatory model for the post-2012 licences. The main changes include: \u2022 separating the wagering and gaming licence to instead license wagering on a stand-alone basis; and \u2022 transitioning from the current gaming operator duopoly to a system where venue operators are licensed to own and operate gaming machines in their own right. After considering the end of licence arrangements in the Gambling Regulation Act 2003 , the former Government formed the view that neither Tatts Group nor TABCORP will be entitled to compensation after the expiration of their current licences. Melbourne   Park   redevelopment   The State has entered into an agreement with Tennis Australia and the Melbourne and Olympic Park Trust to provide for the Australian Open to remain at Melbourne Park until 2036. Stage 1 of the redevelopment of Melbourne Park (total estimated investment of $363 million in the 2010-11 Budget ) was negotiated at the same time. The agreement provided for a number of conditions, including that further improvements will be made to Melbourne Park or that a rights fee will be paid to Tennis Australia, if works beyond Stage 1 do not proceed for the Australian Open to remain at Melbourne Park. Kilmore   East   fire   A number of litigants have lodged claims against the electrical distributors, SPI Electricity Pty Ltd ( SP AusNet ) and PowerCor, in relation to the Coleraine, Horsham, Pomborneit- Weerite, Beechworth and Kilmore East fires. One of the claims is a group proceeding which was issued against electricity distributor SP AusNet in relation to the Kilmore East fire. The plaintiffs' damages claims arise from alleged breaches of statutory duty under the Electrical Safety Act 1998 , negligence and private nuisance. A defence and counterclaim was filed on 24 September 2010 by SP AusNet (the defendants to the original proceeding) in response to the plaintiffs' claim and joining Utility Services Corporation Limited, the Secretary to the Department of Sustainability and Environment, the Country Fire Authority; and the State of Victoria (on behalf of Victoria Police). A defence to the counterclaim was filed on 14 December 2010 by the Secretary to the Department of Sustainability and Environment, the Country Fire Authority, and the State of Victoria (on behalf of Victoria Police). Beechworth   Fire A number of litigants have lodged claims against the electrical distributors, SPI Electricity Pty Ltd ( SP AusNet ) and PowerCor, in relation to the Coleraine, Horsham, Pomborneit- Weerite, Beechworth and Kilmore East fires. There are three claims issued against electricity distributor SP AusNet in relation to the Beechworth fire. One of the proceedings is a class action and there are two separate actions by individuals who have opted out of the class action. The plaintiffs' damages claims arise from alleged breaches of statutory duty under the Electrical Safety Act 1998 , breaches of general duties and private nuisance. A defence and counterclaim was filed on 4 August 2010 by SP AusNet (the defendant to the original proceeding) in response to the plaintiffs' claims and joining Eagle Travel Tower Services Pty Ltd, the Secretary to the Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria. A defence to the counterclaim was filed on 12 November 2010 by the Secretary to the Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria. Current   wagering   licence   arrangements   Potential exposure exists for the Victorian racing industry in relation to the conclusion of the current wagering licence joint venture arrangements in August 2012. The Government has indemnified the racing industry in respect of certain potential commercial matters."

                    "text": "The revised 2010-11 comprehensive operating statement incorporating the results for the nine months to the end of March 2011 is presented in Table B.1. Revised   outcome   for   2010 \u2010 11   The revised general government sector net result from transactions for 2010-11 is estimated at $249.4 million, $622.5 million lower than the original 2010-11 budget estimate and $384 million lower than that estimated in the 2010-11 Budget Update . Of the movement since the budget update, $129.5 million is driven by a decrease in estimated revenue, and $254.5 million from an increase in estimated expenses. Revenue from transactions is budgeted to be $45.4 billion. The main impact on the revenue estimate has been the downward revision in Commonwealth grants of $349.7 million since the 2010-11 Budget Update. GST revenue accounts for $324.6 million of the reduction and reflects a decrease in the estimated overall size of the GST pool. A reduction in the estimate for other Commonwealth grants of $25.1 million since budget update is mainly the result of a rephasing of these Commonwealth receipts. Since the 2010-11 Budget Update there has also been a downward revision of $111.5 million attributed to the rephasing of dividends from 2010-11 to 2011-12 from both the public financial and public non-financial sectors. The decrease in revenue has been offset to some extent by an upward revision in taxation of $439.5 million since the May budget, $134.5 million of which has occurred since the budget update. The upwards revision to taxation revenue since budget update has been largely driven by a $81.1 million increase in estimated land transfer duty mainly from additional commercial transactions, and from stronger forecast employment and wage growth, resulting in an upwards revision to payroll tax. Expenses from transactions are budgeted to be $45.2 billion for 2010-11, which is an increase of $301.4 million since the original published budget. Of this movement, $254.5 million has occurred since 2010-11 Budget Update , mainly driven by additional grants expenditure associated with floods recovery-related payments to local governments, other grants to the Health and Education sectors, and from new government policy decisions. This additional estimated expenditure has been partly offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $142 million since the budget update, mainly due to capital program rephasings and lower than expected asset revaluations. The net result for 2010-11 is expected to be a surplus of $1.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion since budget update which is mainly due to actuarial gains on the superannuation defined benefit plans of $1.3 billion. These gains reflect favourable movement in the bond rate used to value the superannuation liability, as well as better than expected investment returns for 2010-11. Result   for   the   period   to   31   March   2011   For the nine months ending 31 March 2011, the net result from transactions was a surplus of $1.0 billion. Total revenue to the end of March was $34.8 billion, representing 77 per cent of the revised budget estimate of $45.3 billion. This higher than pro-rata revenue outcome mainly reflects the level of GST grants revenue received from the Commonwealth in the year to date, and the upfront recognition of land tax revenue in February and March. Total expenses from transactions at 31 March 2011 totalled $33.7 billion, or 75 per cent of the revised outcome, consistent with expectations for this time of year. Following on from the recognition of land tax revenue in the March quarter and the anticipated flattening out of GST revenue over the remainder of the year, the revised net result from transactions for 2010-11 will be $249.4 million."

Since the 2010-11 Budget Update , estimated net assets at 30 June 2011 have been revised upwards by some $920.8 million, driven predominantly by the expected reduction in the valuation of the superannuation liability previously referred to, offset in part by lower than earlier estimated asset revaluations, mainly in the transport sector. For the nine months to 31 March 2011, net assets have increased by $2.9 billion, representing around 77 per cent of the revised budgeted movement, consistent with the revised budget expectations."

This variation mainly reflects the reduction in expected grants from the Commonwealth and increased operating expenses impacting on the revised net result from transaction for 2010-11 as outlined previously. Infrastructure   investment   As shown in Table B.3, the $2.8 billion estimated net cash inflows from operating activities for 2010-11 provide a significant financing source for the Government's infrastructure investment program in 2010-11 estimated to total $6.7 billion. The Government's net investment in non-financial assets (which includes purchases of property, plant and equipment, capital contributions to other sectors of government and net proceeds from sale of assets) of $6.7 billion is $291.1 million higher than the original published budget. The 2010-11 Budget Update reported an upwards revision of $121.3 million, and there has been a subsequent increase of $169.8 million in expected capital spending for this revision, mainly in the Education sector. For the year to 31 March 2011, infrastructure investment totalling $4.5 billion represents 68 per cent of the revised estimate. Net purchases of non-financial assets at $3.5 billion or 80 per cent of the revised budget of $4.4 billion is well on track. Investments for policy purposes (capital contributions to other sectors) at $977.5 million, are 44 per cent of the revised budget, with the below pro-rata year to date outcome attributed to delays in rail and housing related projects, which are expected to progress later in the year.

(A) Compliance   framework   This report is a special purpose consolidated interim financial report of the general government sector for the quarter ending 31 March 2011 as required by Section 26 of the Financial Management Act 1994 . The Quarterly Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 , relevant Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), including those paragraphs applicable to not-for-profit entities, and AASB Interpretations. This unaudited special purpose financial report should be read in conjunction with the 2009-10 Annual Financial Report and the 2010-11 Mid-Year Financial Report . It only includes explanatory notes that provide relevant information on a quarterly reporting basis. (B) Basis   of   accounting   and   measurement   The accrual basis of accounting has been employed in the preparation of this financial report whereby assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses are recognised in the reporting period to which they relate, regardless of when cash will be received or paid. (C) General   government   sector   economic   entity   The general government sector includes all government departments, offices and other government bodies engaged in providing services free of charge or at prices significantly below their cost of production. The services provided by these entities are financed mainly through taxes, other compulsory levies and user charges. The general government sector is not a separate entity but represents a sector within the State of Victoria reporting entity. (D) Basis   of   consolidation   The Quarterly Financial Report includes all reporting entities in the general government sector that are controlled by the State. Details of entities consolidated for the general government sector are included in Note 25 of Chapter 1, which should be read in conjunction with Note 40 Controlled entities of the 2009-10 Annual Financial Report . In the process of reporting the general government sector as a single economic entity, all material transactions and balances within the sector are eliminated. Entities in the public non-financial corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors are not consolidated into the financial statements of the Victorian general government sector, but are accounted for as equity investments measured at the Government's proportional share of the carrying amount of net assets of the PNFC and PFC sector entities before consolidation eliminations. Where the carrying amount of the entities' net assets before consolidation eliminations is less than zero, the amount is not included."

                    "text": "This appendix provides historical data for the major fiscal aggregates. Wherever possible, adjustments have been made to make the historical series consistent with the forward estimates. Table C.1 shows the trends in general government sector aggregate cash flows over the period 1986-87 to 2014-15. This table of historical data has been compiled in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, and from 2004-05 onwards is consistent with the cash flow statement included in Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and notes . Note all footnotes are shown at the end of the table. The data from 1997-98 include the transactions of government schools and arts institutions on a gross operating basis, as well as the full trading operations of TAFE institutes and hospitals, nursing homes and ambulances. Although this expanded coverage does not materially influence the net operating result for the general government sector, it does significantly increase the inflows and outflows presented in the cash flow statement. Table C.3 shows the general government sector net operating balance from 1996-97 to 2014-15, with 2004-05 onwards presented in compliance with AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting. Table C.5 presents general government sector operating expenses, sourced from Australian Bureau of Statistics historical data, classified by government purpose. The underlying data from 1961-62 to 1997-98 represent a conversion from the original cash series to an accruals basis by estimating depreciation and superannuation expenses based on statistical modelling. Although this conversion provides a basis for comparison both with total expenses in the current series of accrual GFS information from 1998-2015 in Table C.5 and in Chapter 1 Estimated Financial Statements and Notes Table 1.1, the estimated accrued expense items have not been apportioned to individual purpose classifications. The absence of these splits between functional classifications in Table C.5 therefore represents a break in the series and it is not possible to compare individual purpose categories with those in other tables.

Payments in later years were for voluntary redundancy and targeted separation packages across the general government sector and are included under 'employee entitlements'. (b) Privatisation and other abnormal cash items to the general government sector include: - 1986-87 to 1990-91: payments received from the former Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works regarding the transfer of ownership of the Thomson Cardinia Dam of $35 million a year; - 1990-91: net proceeds from the sale of the State Bank ($1 257 million); - 1992-93: sale of the State Insurance Office ($140 million); - 1993-94: recall of capital from the Transport Accident Commission ($1 200 million), wind-up of the Victorian Equity Trust ($437 million), casino licence fee ($200 million), offset by a special payment to the State Superannuation Fund ($1 399 million); - 1994-95: sale of Totalisator Agency Board ($609 million); - 1995-96: sale of electricity sector businesses ($4 641 million), 1996-97 ($4 262 million), and 1997-98 ($2 101 million) offset by a special payment to the State Superannuation Fund ($490 million); and - 1998-99: sale of the remainder of the electricity businesses ($361 million), gas businesses ($4 690 million), Victorian Plantations Corporation ($550 million), Aluvic ($401 million), V/Line Freight ($20 million), offset by a special payment to reduce the State's unfunded superannuation liabilities ($2 574 million). (c) From 1997-98, includes school own purpose receipts and payments which boosted sales of goods and services and other receipts by up to $500 million, but had little impact on the net cash flows because of offsetting payments. This year also saw the introduction of tax equivalent receipts from public non-financial corporations and public financial corporations. (d) From 1998-99, includes a capital asset charge receipt from the PNFC sector, offset by a similar increase in grants and transfer payments. (e) Cash and deposits at beginning of reporting period in 2005-06 do not equal cash and deposits at end of reporting period in 2004-05, due to a change in definition of cash and cash equivalents under A-IFRS. (f) Goods and services from 2007-08 onwards include other payments. (g) Net borrowings from 2007-08 onwards includes advances received and deposits received.
