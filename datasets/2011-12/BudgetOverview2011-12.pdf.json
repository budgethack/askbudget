It builds a more sustainable budget position, improves services and plans for future growth. The Coalition Government's first budget delivers our election commitments to: \u2022 ease the burden on families; \u2022 restore community safety, deliver quality health services, invest in our children's education; \u2022 improve and rebuild our transport infrastructure; and \u2022 rebuild regional and country Victoria. The Coalition is delivering this budget against the backdrop of significant financial challenges. This year, the Commonwealth Grants Commission announced an unprecedented $2.5 billion cut to Victoria's GST revenue, and combined with the influence of a slowing national economy, Victoria is now forecast to receive $4.1 billion less in GST revenue than expected. The Commonwealth has also announced the deferral of $550 million in promised infrastructure payments. In addition, a number of key projects announced by the previous government face significant cost overruns due to poor management and under funding. The exposure for Victoria's finances is $2 billion. Importantly, the Coalition is undertaking the necessary work to put these projects on to a sustainable financial footing, with strong management, and to be delivered on time and on budget. Over a number of years, Victoria's underlying budget position has deteriorated and public debt has grown significantly. The Coalition is implementing a clear and comprehensive plan to improve Victoria's finances and foster a stronger, more competitive, growing economy. In its first budget the Coalition is delivering on our commitments to Victoria, prioritising vital community services, and investing in the infrastructure that will deliver a higher quality of living for Victoria's future such as: \u2022 Making the community safer through a record commitment to additional police and protective services officers, as well as supporting communities to tackle local crime, reduce violence and address anti-social behaviour. \u2022 Improving and rebuilding our transport infrastructure by upgrading public transport services, planning and building new rail services, removing metropolitan and rural level crossings, upgrading local and major roads across metropolitan and regional Victoria, and improving our taxi services. \u2022 Improving our health system by delivering new hospital beds, expanding and upgrading hospital facilities, providing extra ambulance stations and officers and funding a substantial expansion of mental health services. \u2022 Supporting regional and country Victoria by building new hospitals, upgrading infrastructure and boosting regional businesses. \u2022 Protecting vulnerable Victorians through increases to frontline child protection personnel, delivering additional supported accommodation places, respite care and support for Victorians with a disability, their families and carers. \u2022 Delivering new education opportunities by building and upgrading our schools including a record investment in upgrading special schools, providing new programs to improve learning outcomes and new initiatives to improve student safety. \u2022 Helping households manage the cost of living by reducing the cost of ambulance membership, extending electricity and other concessions, and cutting stamp duty for first homebuyers, young farmers and seniors. \u2022 Restoring confidence in government by providing modern, open and accountable government institutions with higher standards of integrity. The Coalition is beginning a program of major reforms and implementing practical initiatives to assist the most vulnerable in our community, those who need a helping hand, and the organisations that do so much to improve local communities. We are lifting service delivery, building the infrastructure to meet tomorrow's community needs and securing our future economic prosperity to provide a higher standard of living for all Victorians. Kim Wells Treasurer The 2011-12 Budget lays out the state of Victoria's finances and takes initial steps to achieve a more sustainable budget position. Since coming to office, the Government has faced a number of issues which have significant implications for the budget. In particular: \u2022 A number of existing projects face cost pressures, with an aggregate cost overrun in the order of $2 billion. \u2022 The Commonwealth Grants Commission's assessment has cut Victoria's share of GST revenue by $2.5 billion over four years and this has been compounded by a further $1.6 billion reduction in revenue from softer overall GST receipts. The combined effect of this GST reduction is to cut revenue by nearly $1 billion a year over the forward estimates. \u2022 The Commonwealth's decision to delay funding for projects, including the Regional Rail Link and the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre has reduced revenue by $550 million. These emerging issues have exposed the vulnerabilities in the underlying budget position inherited by the Government. The Independent Review of State Finances has found in its interim report that Victoria's finances were on an unsustainable path. Specifically: \u2022 over the past decade, spending growth has outstripped revenue growth; \u2022 the operating surplus has relied on temporary Commonwealth stimulus payments; \u2022 public debt has risen substantially; and \u2022 there is a need to increase infrastructure spending overall. Addressing these challenges will not be achieved overnight. The impact of project cost pressures and reduced GST revenue has resulted in a lower operating surplus and increased debt relative to the levels forecast in the 2010-11 Budget Update."

The Government will deliver on its commitment to have surpluses of at least $100 million a year, with a surplus of $140 million in 2011-12 and averaging $164 million over the forward estimates. Significant efficiency savings will be achieved, totalling around $2.2 billion over five years - equivalent to just over half of the GST revenue lost. Expenditure growth has been curtailed, with spending forecast to rise by an average of 3.2 per cent a year over the forward estimates. Debt as a percentage of gross state product (GSP) will stabilise, and net financial liabilities will fall as a percentage of GSP by 2014-15 and remain consistent with retaining Victoria's triple-A credit rating. To address the issue of project cost overruns, the introduction of more rigorous oversight by the Department of Treasury and Finance will ensure major projects are delivered on time and on budget. Existing programs will be refocused to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. The fiscal strategy emphasises the importance of the Government's policy of having no wage outcomes greater than 2.5 per cent, unless they are funded by productivity gains."

                    "text": "Victoria's economy is diverse and strong, but faces challenges with implications for the fiscal outlook. The Victorian economy has performed relatively well since the global financial crisis, but is now experiencing slower growth due to delayed recovery in business investment, slower population growth and pressures on important sectors due to the high Australian dollar. A prolonged and uneven global economic recovery, rising oil prices and capacity constraints in the national economy may affect the short-term economic outlook. Forecast GSP growth has been downgraded to 2.5 per cent in 2010-11, rising to 3 per cent in 2011-12, with an expected return to growth in business investment partially offset by the wind-down of the fiscal stimulus. While the renewed resources boom provides many economic opportunities, it has placed upward pressure on the Australian dollar, presenting a major challenge for Victoria's traditional exporters, particularly in the education, tourism and manufacturing industries. Victorian businesses have reduced investment activities since the wind-down of Commonwealth Government stimulus policies. Recent weakness in non-dwelling construction activity has been partially due to weather-related delays. Despite this, Victoria's labour market remains strong, with employment during the year ending March 2011 growing by 3.5 per cent. Housing approvals remain at above average levels, with Victoria accounting for more than a third of national approvals. With the right policy settings, Victoria has the ability to lead other Australian states and territories in the area of housing supply and the ability to manage population growth. Victoria's recent economic growth has been underpinned by an increasing population. Population growth is now slowing, largely due to declining net overseas migration - although business visa applications have recently increased. Over the medium term, the Victorian economy needs to adjust to the change in relative prices caused by high terms of trade and the strong Australian dollar. This can only be achieved through efforts to boost productivity. To boost Victoria's productivity and competitiveness and ensure the economy remains robust, the Government is implementing a comprehensive reform agenda focused on reducing business costs and regulatory burdens and more efficient, responsive and transparent public services.

Building Victoria's preparedness and resilience to natural disasters Victoria's emergency response strategy and capability must be strengthened in response to the recommendations of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission, as well as lessons learned from recent floods. Accordingly, the budget provides: \u2022 $13 million over four years for Victorian State Emergency Service (SES) staff to fill leadership roles in incident management teams and improve SES capacity to discharge its lead agency responsibilities during major events; \u2022 $9.6 million to support SES volunteers and SES operational costs; \u2022 $9.3 million over four years for the SES to implement a new training model; \u2022 $1.4 million for the Bushfire Response Planning Unit; and \u2022 $6 million in capital funding for the SES in 2011-12 to buy new mobile command and control vehicles, and to replace critical emergency response assets, including communications equipment. Funding is provided for the first stage of the Government's commitment to enhance the capacity of emergency services to respond to bushfires through investment in infrastructure in the Country Fire Authority and SES. Sixty stations will be upgraded and a total of 101 fire fighting vehicles will be purchased as part of the Government's commitment to upgrade more than 250 stations and purchase additional fire fighting equipment over the first term of government. The Government will invest $19 million over five years to repair and restore parts of Victoria's flood warning network, and improve the system by developing a web-based flood intelligence platform. The Government will provide $50 million to fund safer electricity assets following recommendations of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. This will reduce the number of bushfires started by ageing electricity assets. The Government is delivering much-needed financial assistance to ease cost of living pressures on Victorian households."

Through these programs, regional and rural communities across Victoria will have access to tours by large and small performing arts companies and be able to engage in the development of artistic works. The budget will provide $32 million to a range of Victorian arts institutions, including the Victorian College of the Arts, the State Library and the Melbourne Recital Centre. Additional funding for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival will ensure it remains one of Victoria's iconic major events. Support will also continue for the Melbourne Writers Festival. The Government will provide $600 000 over four years for the screen industry to boost ties with Bollywood by developing the Indian Film Festival. This funding includes establishing a training course in film making for school students. The budget will provide funding to establish an Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC). The IBAC will investigate, expose and prevent corruption across the entire public sector. It will also educate the public sector and the community about corruption and its harmful effects on public administration and the community. Any citizen will be able to make a complaint to the IBAC about corruption. The IBAC will have jurisdiction over all members of the Government, their staff, the judiciary, local government, members of Parliament and their staff, police and the public service. Its function will be to investigate allegations or complaints of corrupt conduct, including matters referred to it by either House of Parliament. The IBAC will also have a strong prevention and education function, and will take over the functions of the Office of Police Integrity. The IBAC is a key part of the Government's commitment to restore honest, transparent and accountable government in Victoria. The Government will provide $7.9 million to establish an independent Office of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Commissioner. Providing public access to government information is an important mechanism to enhance government accountability in a representative democracy. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 provides a key means by which the public may access documents held by government. However, there are a number of issues with the current FOI regime, including excessive and unreasonable delays, and limited assistance to FOI applicants pursuing documents of interest."
