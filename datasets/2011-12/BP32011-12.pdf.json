It provides performance targets against which departmental service delivery will be measured, and an appendix that details proposed changes to previously published performance measures. This budget paper outlines initiatives that are being funded in this budget, including commitments made in the Government's 2010 election platform, renewed funding for programs that were not funded beyond 30 June 2011, and other initiatives to meet current and future service needs. Budget Paper No. 3 also highlights initiatives that contribute funding to local councils together with an overview of state funding arrangements with the local government sector. Budget Paper No. 3 forms part of the suite of budget papers. The Victorian Economic and Financial Statement released on 14 April 2011 highlights the fiscal and economic challenges confronting the Government, including significant cost pressures. The Statement foreshadows the broad direction of reform the Government will pursue in order to address these challenges over time. Budget Paper No. 2 Strategy and Outlook describes the State's economic and financial position and performance while also outlining the Government's fiscal and economic reform strategy. Budget Paper No. 4 State Capital Program describes Victoria's asset investment program. Budget Paper No. 5 Statement of Finances provides the financial details of the aggregated Victorian general government sector as outlined in Budget Paper No. 2."

                    "text": "The 2011-12 Budget delivers services to the Victorian community that implement the Government's election commitments and other priorities. The Government is placing a strong focus on providing a higher standard of living for all Victorians. Disaster response Victorians have suffered from the effects of significant flood damage in 2010 and 2011, and continue to deal with the long running impacts of the devastating bushfires of 2009. The 2011-12 Budget includes a range of initiatives across the four key components of emergency management: preparation, prevention, response and recovery. Flood affected people, communities and businesses will be supported through this budget, including through programs to assist people suffering from loss of employment, additional health and wellbeing services, and financial advice to farmers and producers. Businesses in areas of extreme damage will receive flood recovery support through grants and concessional loans, mentoring services from a panel of business advisers, and additional tourism, marketing and industry assistance initiatives. Assistance will be delivered through initiatives including the Apprenticeship Retention program, the Community Recovery Fund, the Interim Accommodation Plan and the Business Flood Recovery Fund. Part of this flood recovery package is a voluntary buyback scheme to help irrigators on the Lower Loddon floodplain recover, and protect the region from future flooding. The Government will provide funding to repair damaged infrastructure, including repairs to Victoria's arterial roads and bridges, and the affected regional rail network. Support will be provided to rebuild community assets, such as public halls, sporting clubrooms, grounds and historic buildings. Funds will also be provided to restore and improve the flood information and warning system. A Bushfire Response Planning Unit will support people rebuilding homes in bushfire prone areas and the Government will implement the Retreat and Resettlement Strategy involving the non-compulsory acquisition of land in high bushfire risk areas. In addition, the Government will provide a mobile rebuilding advisory service. Importantly, the Government will begin work on reducing the risks of bushfires by starting a $50 million Safer Electricity Assets Fund to replace ageing electricity assets with safer technologies as recommended by the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. Cost of living In recent years, Victorians have faced significant cost of living pressures. These have included the impact of rising water and electricity bills. This budget takes steps to ease cost of living pressures in a variety of ways. The Government will support homebuyers, pensioners and farmers through a range of land transfer duty cuts. First homebuyers will benefit from the continuation of programs such as the First Home Owner Grant and the First Home Bonus (including the Regional Bonus), and eligible buyers will receive a reduction in land transfer duty rates. The stamp duty concession threshold for pensioners and concession card holders will be extended and young farmers will benefit from land transfer duty exemptions on certain property purchases. The Government has taken important steps to assist families in most need with the cost of essential services, including extending energy concessions for concession card holders to provide a year-round 17.5 per cent reduction in their electricity bills. The annual cap for water and sewerage concessions will be increased in 2011-12 to compensate households for water and sewerage prices increases. Additional support will include providing better access to kindergarten services for eligible low income families, support for children with disabilities in early childhood settings, and targeted support for small rural kindergartens. Ambulance membership fees will be halved, supporting and encouraging families to obtain this important emergency cover and avoid the significant cost of uninsured ambulance usage. Community safety The Government is investing heavily in a comprehensive community safety strategy. The strategy combines an increased police presence, appropriate sentencing policies and a range of targeted interventions to address the underlying causes of crime. Public safety and crime reduction will be improved with funding of $437 million over four years. This will include the deployment of 940 protective services officers to patrol metropolitan railway stations and four major regional stations, and bringing forward the deployment of 1 700 new police officers by November 2014. The addition of 108 beds to the male prison system will enable the effective management of the prison population, while funding for the electronic monitoring of offenders and suspects in the community will improve community safety by reducing the risk of re-offending. The Government will establish the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation to reduce the incidence and severity of problem gambling across Victoria and facilitate assistance to problem gamblers. The Government is committed to retaining and supporting the Courts Integrated Services Program in relation to defendants with multiple and complex needs. The budget provides $22 million over four years to continue the provision of case management and offender supervision to reduce re-offending. The Government will provide support for community safety initiatives, including Neighbourhood Watch, the Community Safety Fund and the Public Infrastructure Safety Fund, which will assist the implementation of local crime prevention projects. Rebuilding our transport system Improving the transport system is a critical element in the Government's policy agenda. High quality transport options are of vital importance in improving liveability, encouraging new business and managing population growth. The Government's strategy encompasses roads, metropolitan and regional trains, trams, freight and taxi services. Funding of more than $1 billion will deliver improvements urgently needed by the Victorian community to the standard and safety of the rail and road transport networks. The Government will invest $484 million for rail network improvements including $222 million for seven new X'Trapolis trains as stage 1 of a rolling stock procurement program for 40 new trains and the establishment of a new Maintaining our Rail Network Fund for rail asset renewal and maintenance; to be overseen by a new independent Victorian Public Transport Development Authority. Road improvement initiatives of more than $600 million include increased funding for local councils to maintain and restore country roads and bridges across Victoria, and the installation of flashing lights and boom barriers at up to 75 country level crossings. The Government will also fund the next stage of the M80 upgrade and road widening, including upgrades to interchanges and a Freeway Management System. The Government has commissioned an inquiry into the performance of the taxi and hire car service industries and will initiate a number of feasibility studies into aspects of the transport system. These studies will include the examination of options for an inter-capital high speed railway, the construction of rail links to Doncaster and Melbourne Airport, the feasibility of relocating car stevedoring functions from Melbourne (Webb Dock) to Geelong, and the development of a rail link to Rowville. On top of this significant investment to deliver urgent transport system improvements, the Government will provide additional funding for the Regional Rail Link project that will provide vital infrastructure for Melbourne's western growth corridor and for country Victoria. Regional and country Victoria The Government has a strong commitment to delivering quality services and strengthening local communities beyond metropolitan Melbourne. This includes Victoria's key regional centres, but also places a renewed focus on smaller rural communities across the State. The $1 billion Regional Growth Fund will create jobs and build industries in regional Victoria, and the First Farm Grant program will provide planning and development support for young farmers. Funding of more than $313 million will drive prosperity and growth in regional Victoria by supporting regional businesses, tourism, and health services. Funding will allow the Geelong Manufacturing Council to work with Deakin University's Geelong campus to partner postgraduate students with local businesses. The tourism industry across regional Victoria will be supported through funding to build key events and activities, and to improve skills and service standards, including through the industry supported Victorian Tourism Workforce Development Plan 2010-2016. Other initiatives include showcasing rural and regional areas as potential investment and living destinations, and supporting farming businesses through the Farmers' Markets Support program. The Government will improve the health of regional Victorians by upgrading and boosting the capacity of rural health services, including additional funding for the new Bendigo Hospital, redevelopment or expansion of hospitals in Echuca, Kerang and Mildura, and providing incentives to medical professionals to work in rural areas. Artistic endeavour in Victoria's regional communities will benefit from funding through the Regional Arts Transformation program, which will invite artists to develop art on location in small towns and invite towns to develop an artwork of their own, and support major performing arts companies with the costs of touring to regional Victoria. Health and hospitals The Government is committed to delivering efficient and responsive health services with programs that improve health outcomes across the Victorian community. The 2011-12 Budget highlights the Government's key priorities. Despite difficult fiscal circumstances, substantial hospital operations growth funding has been allocated to the health system, including the first tranche of the 800 new hospital beds promised during the election. To improve the health and wellbeing of Victorians, the Government has provided more than $2.0 billion over four years for new initiatives to improve hospital, mental health, ambulance, aged care, dental health, and public health services. This funding includes $1.2 billion over four years to deliver election commitments. The funding announced in this budget will provide an immediate boost to health services, will improve access to elective surgery and emergency department services including in regional and country Victoria, and deliver new assets that will grow health services into the future. Capital funding has been provided to deliver election commitments such as the Rural Capital Support Fund, expanding the Box Hill and Bendigo hospitals, and other capital investments including Frankston, Maroondah and Northern Hospitals. The Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre will also be completed. Education and skills The Government has a strong policy agenda across all education settings. In early childhood, the Government recognises the significant returns from early intervention, particularly targeted at those families who might otherwise not benefit from early childhood education and care. In school education, the Government supports a high quality public education system as well as supporting the parental choice of an accessible and affordable alternative through Catholic and independent schools. The Government is making substantial investments to upgrade community based kindergarten and children's services, to assist small rural kindergartens to meet administrative and operational costs and support young children with disabilities and their families to attend and thrive at kindergarten. In schooling, children with disabilities will benefit from a significant boost in funding for programs and capital investment, including much needed equipment for vision impaired children. New funding of $24 million will provide for mathematics and science specialists in government primary schools to build science and maths skills in the primary teaching profession and lift students' interest in science and maths from an early age. Science graduates will be attracted into teaching through new scholarships and new partnerships will be forged with science and maths businesses, research institutes, universities and TAFEs. Language education will be enhanced through better resourced community languages schools. Schools will be encouraged, through additional funding, to build areas of specialisation in innovative fields. Safety and wellbeing of young people at government schools will be enhanced, with funding of $124 million to continue existing and increase the number of Primary Welfare Officers, and the powers of principals and teachers to improve discipline and safety in schools will be strengthened. Teachers will be offered the necessary professional development to manage the classroom. Chaplains will be trained to provide support services to students. Anti-bullying programs will receive a major funding boost. The Government will increase its investment in schooling and opportunities for vulnerable and disengaged children through an innovative pilot program to transition young people back into effective education. TAFE and other vocational education and training qualifications will be made more accessible with a restoration of concessions for young people undertaking high level courses and expanded eligibility criteria for government subsidised training. Supporting local communities The Government will encourage vibrant and self-reliant communities built on high levels of voluntary effort and civic participation. In the 2011-12 Budget , the Government has provided more than $50 million to increase participation in Victorian communities, including funding for volunteers, for the sustainability of the not-for-profit sector to meet growing and challenging demands, to boost participation in civic activities, and to contribute to the cost of community infrastructure and amenities. The Government will support access to and participation in the arts, sport and recreation activities by providing $24 million for the Victorian College of the Arts, and funding for a new Community Support and Recreational Sports Package. Sport and recreational facilities will be improved through funding for the State Sports Facilities Project in Albert Park and to support the Skilled Stadium Stage 3 redevelopment in Geelong. Both of these sporting facilities include a commitment to community sporting programs. In addition the Government will continue to deliver funding, through contributions from the Community Support Fund, for sporting facilities that were previously funded through the Community Facilities Funding program, subject to the usual approval processes and capacity. Funding will also be provided to celebrate Victoria's rich military history through commemorative events, the restoration of memorials, and educational activities. The Government will provide a new Victorian Multicultural Grants Program with funding to develop African community leadership skills in order to increase confidence and self-sufficiency in Victoria's African community, and establish an annual calendar of major multicultural events throughout regional and metropolitan Victoria. In addition, the Government will establish a South Asian building fund for the construction of new, and the enhancement of existing, community spaces and facilities within four identified South Asian community organisations. Protecting families in need The Government has established a judicial review of Victoria's child protection system. Additional resources will also be invested in the system, including the employment of an additional 47 child protection staff. Young Victorians will be supported to make better choices and be given opportunities to access better housing and community activities through services including Headspace Communities of Youth Services, and regional offices of the Centre for Multicultural Youth. Victorian Seniors and people with a disability, their families and carers will benefit from increased support for accommodation, respite care, and aids and equipment. Indigenous Victorians Indigenous Victorians who have made significant contributions to address Indigenous disadvantage will be recognised through the Honour Roll for Indigenous Victorians, and Indigenous organisations will be supported to build capacity to meet statutory obligations and organisational challenges. Enhancing urban liveability One of Victoria's greatest assets is the built form of its cities and towns, and the Government is committed to fostering change and growth in a manner that respects this, and returns fairness and certainty to the urban planning system. The Government will provide $9.7 million over four years to deliver a new metropolitan planning strategy for Melbourne, which will be underpinned by substantial community engagement. The strategy will draw on the findings of a liveability audit, activity area boundary definition, audit of green wedge land and open space, and an assessment of the development potential of government owned land. It will also provide for the development of land use adaptation plans for Victoria's coastal settlements. Funding is also provided to deliver new guidelines and clearer planning policies that will provide greater fairness and certainty for communities, developers and investors in relation to applications for new wind farm development. Funding of $52 million will be provided for urban revitalisation and development, and to support local government activities. Funding will support local development such as the Frankston Activity Area revitalisation and ongoing services to maintain Victoria's heritage assets. In addition, the Government will contribute to local government initiatives, including support for capital works at public libraries, and energy efficiency initiatives such as the Green Light Plan to save money and cut emissions. The environment Through a range of initiatives, the Government will begin to restore and improve the protection of Victoria's environment. The Government's approach includes a focus on facilitating community engagement with, and appreciation of, Victoria's natural assets. Funding of more than $169 million will support the management of Victoria's parks and land, continue 65 park ranger positions across Victoria, provide access to recreational opportunities and encourage sustainable use of Victoria's environmental assets. The Government will provide grants for community groups engaged in managing the environment, continue funding the management of pests and weeds on public land, provide $12 million to restore Landcare in Victoria's regions, and assist with the management of National Parks, beaches and the foreshore around Port Phillip Bay. Sustainability initiatives totalling $121 million involve water management projects, rebates to encourage water efficiency in households and small businesses, and upgrades to street lighting for energy efficiency. Integrity of government Victorians rightly expect high standards from those in public office. The 2011-12 Budget funds a range of initiatives aimed at strengthening the integrity of Victoria's democratic and public institutions. The accountability of the Government will be improved through the establishment of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), which will investigate, expose and prevent corruption involving or affecting public authorities and public officials. IBAC will also educate public officials and members of the public about corruption and its harmful effects on public administration and the community. The Government will also establish the Independent Office of the Freedom of Information Commissioner to promote transparency, and an independent review panel to scrutinise and approve government advertising. The Government's priorities are reflected in its decision to achieve substantial savings in areas such as government advertising, communications budgets and ministerial staff numbers. A new Independent Children's Commissioner will be appointed and report directly to Parliament. The Commissioner will have the power to initiate reviews regarding the safety of children, the scope of which will extend to children not known to the child protection system who are identified by the Coroner as having suffered from abuse and neglect. Funding will be provided to restore access to local crime statistics by Neighbourhood Watch groups, which will allow communities to learn more about crime in their local area. The Government will also provide funding to review budget reporting measures, which will help improve the usefulness and transparency of performance reporting measures on the Hospital Performance website. Integrity in government includes a commitment to ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and efficiently. To this end, the Government is focused on driving efficiencies in service delivery and instituting the most significant Independent Review of State Finances in 20 years. A productivity reform agenda will be implemented that will include initiatives to reduce business costs and improve the efficiency of the public sector, including its provision of infrastructure. The Independent Review of State Finances commissioned earlier in 2011 will also inform this agenda. Business The Government is committed to driving a stronger, more competitive economy and business environment in Victoria that will assist industries to generate jobs and investment, improve the capacity of business to compete nationally and globally, and reduce business regulatory burdens. These programs will also help business identify skilled migrants needed to fill critical gaps in the workforce, and promote collaboration on research between industry and the education sector to the benefit of the Victorian economy and society. Support for the Office of the Victorian Small Business Commissioner will help provide small businesses with practical assistance and access to quick, lower cost dispute resolution. Funding for Export Victoria aims to increase exports into new and growing markets and to ensure Victorian industry has the necessary information to capture emerging export opportunities. The Industry Capability Network and the Investment Support Program will focus on expanding job opportunities and investment in Victoria, including in advanced manufacturing. Victorian science and technology investment will be increased through the establishment of networks between research and industry sectors to promote and enable technology transfer between education and research institutions and business. Further, an Office of the Lead Scientist will aid the development and direction of innovation and science policy and a Victorian Biotechnology Advisory Council will facilitate a long-term and coordinated approach to build on advances in the biotechnology sector. Tourism Victoria will undertake targeted outreach and information services in key markets, and Victoria's world-class educational institutions will be promoted under the banner of 'Victoria: Leader in Learning'. The Government's initiatives will promote Victoria as a destination of choice for people, business and investment."

                    "text": "This chapter details the goods and services (outputs) that each government department intends to deliver in 2011-12 and describes how these services are designed to contribute to departmental objectives and strategic priorities. An output represents the aggregate of goods or services which are either produced or delivered by, or on behalf of, a department and its agencies. Departmental output statements are a key accountability mechanism for departmental service delivery as they include performance standards for each output that enable the assessment of departments' service delivery. Performance measures are provided to describe the cost of each output, the quantity of output units to be delivered, the expected level of quality, and the timeliness of service delivery. Departmental outputs and the performance measures used to evaluate service delivery are assessed annually for their continuing relevance and robustness. Where departments have introduced changes to their outputs, these changes are reflected in a summary table with an explanation as to the nature of the change. The Government has invited the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee (PAEC) to review proposed changes to output performance measures. This is to ensure measures that are substantially changed, or are proposed to be discontinued, are given a high degree of scrutiny. This review also ensures that comparisons of service delivery performance can be maintained from year to year, while recognising the importance of annually evaluating the quality of measures. In the 2011-12 Budget some departments have introduced changes to the outputs and associated performance measures. These changes mainly reflect the impact of machinery of government changes since the 2010-11 Budget as well as the implementation of new organisation/business structures to better facilitate improvements in service delivery. Information about these changes is provided within each department's output statement. Within the output statements, 'nm' refers to a new performance measure and 'na' refers to data either not being available or not applicable in the specified year. Where a department has included a new measure in 2011-12, historical performance data has been provided, where available, to assist with comparability of the department's performance over time. Structure and changes This year, Chapter 3 includes several changes designed to increase transparency in government reporting. Financial tables Each departmental output statement includes two new financial tables. One details the amounts available to the department from Parliamentary authority while the other outlines income generated through transactions. These tables were previously found in Budget Paper No. 4 Statement of Finances , now Budget Paper No. 5. The sources of Parliamentary authority available to a department include 'Annual appropriations' in the Appropriation (2011-12) Bill to fund the provision of outputs, additions to the net asset base and payments made on behalf of the State. Payments made on behalf of the State include grants for on-passing and superannuation payments. A department's income from transactions includes appropriations to fund the provision of outputs described in this chapter and other income to fund the operations of the department. Total expenditure for departments can be found in Budget Paper No. 5, Chapter 3 Departmental financial statements . Changes to performance measures For some outputs, performance measures that were reported in the 2010-11 departmental output statements may not be reported in 2011-12. This could occur either because the program has ceased, improved measures have been identified or new data sets provide improved performance information. Performance measures that are proposed to no longer be reported in 2011-12 are identified in Appendix A - Output performance measures for review by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee . Common reasons for the proposed discontinuation of performance measures include the achievement of milestones in a period, project/program completion, the impact of policy decisions, the implementation of different programs, and the development of superior alternative measures. Proposed discontinued or substantially changed measures highlighted in Appendix A will be presented to the PAEC after the release of the 2011-12 Budget for review."

(b) The remaining components of this output have either been moved to the Investment Attraction and Facilitation or Exports outputs or have been proposed to be discontinued. All machinery of government changes resulting from the November 2010 election took effect on 1 January 2011. The following table summarises the Department's total output cost.

(b) Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget reflects new funding received for the Regional Aviation Fund, Industry Capability Network, Industry Sustainability Working Committee and the establishment of the Office of the Lead Scientist. In addition, variations in annual funding have occurred for the Industry Transition Fund, Transition to a Global Future, Skills for Growth, Victorian Innovation Statement, the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre, Biotechnology Grants and the National ICT Australia programs. (c) The 2010-11 Budget represents the proportion of performance measures transferred from the Regional Economic Development, Investment and Promotion output. Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised reflects additional funding received for Transition to a Global Future as well as the impact of the estimated carryover of funding from 2010-11 to 2011-12 for the Victorian Industry and Manufacturing Strategy and the Business Development Program. Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget reflects new funding received for Export Victoria, Victoria-Leader in Learning and 2012 Expo in Yeosu, South Korea. In addition, variations in annual funding have occurred for International Airshow, India Strategy, International Education Strategy and Regional Blueprint initiatives. (d) Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised reflects a greater allocation of corporate expenditure as a result of machinery of government changes and the impact of the carryover of funding from 2010-11 to 2011-12 for the New Workforce Partnerships, Return to Earning and other employment initiatives. Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget reflects new funding priorities under the Employment Start Up Program. (e) Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised reflects additional funding received for Natural Disaster Recovery and Major Events. (f) Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised reflects the impact of the initial recognition of Kew Residential Development land sales and the estimated carryover from 2010-11 to 2011-12 for Major Projects funding. Variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget reflects new funding for an international competition to restore Flinders Street Station and the impact of the initial recognition of Kew Residential Development land sales. (g) The 2010-11 total output cost for the Department is lower than in 2010-11 Budget papers as it includes the full year impact of the machinery of government changes. The changes include the transfer of the Skills output to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, and the transfer of the Regional Infrastructure Development and a portion of the Regional Economic Development, Investment and Promotion outputs to the Department of Planning and Community Development. (h) Total output cost for 2011-12 Budget may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 5, Chapter 3 Departmental financial statements due to additional statements in Budget Paper No. 5 that are not included in departmental output costs. Figures for 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised have been amended to reflect machinery of government changes and will not equate to total expenses reported in Departmental financial statements ."

In 2011-12 these objectives will inform the Department's work in implementing the Government's commitment to creating a transparent and accountable approach to health service delivery in Victoria; improved health services performance; and system capacity within a tight fiscal environment."

A further step in this process commences with the 2011-12 budget papers which include a range of new output measures for hospital quality and safety, hospital emergency services and ambulance response times. Details of these are outlined in the budget tables."

(b) The movement in the Department of Health's 2011-12 Budget compared with the 2010-11 Budget is primarily due to: - funding provided for government policy commitments including the full-year effect of initiative funding announced in previous years' budgets; - indexation funding provided for anticipated cost increases in 2011-12; - output price increases for depreciation and capital asset charge costs associated with the approved asset investment program for 2011-12; - changes to Commonwealth funding for a number of programs; and - increases in income from sales of goods and services, particularly for Public Hospitals and Ambulance Services; (c) The 2010-11 Target and 2010-11 Expected Outcome reflects a full year presentation of the Office of Senior Victorians, which transferred from the Department of Planning and Community Development on 1 January 2011. (d) The 2010-11 Expected Outcome and 2011-12 Target reflects changes to Commonwealth/State agreements including a reduction in Commonwealth vaccine funding resulting from new Commonwealth responsibilities for direct purchasing of flu vaccinations.

(b) Variations in the Department of Human Services' 2011-12 Budget compared with the 2010-11 Budget are primarily due to funding provided for government policy commitments including the full-year effect of initiative funding announced in previous years' budgets and indexation funding provided for anticipated cost increases in 2011-12. (c) 2011-12 Budget reflects additional investment in recruitment training and development for youth justice custodial workers, improved safety and security at the Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre, diversion and rehabilitation of young offenders through intensive bail supervision, additional community based youth services workers and alcohol rehabilitative services for youth justice clients. (d) The output summary includes funding for transport concessions transferred to the Department of Transport. This funding is reflected in the Department of Transport's Public Transport Services outputs. (e) 2010-11 Revised estimate for Concessions to Pensioners and Beneficiaries is higher than the 2010-11 Budget estimate due to an expected increase in concession payments arising from higher utility prices including energy, municipal, water and sewerage and the commencement from 1 March 2011 of the Annual Electricity Concession. (f) 2011-12 Budget estimate is higher than the 2010-11 Revised estimate primarily due to the full year impact of the Annual Electricity Concessions, which extended the previous Winter Energy Concessions by six months. (g) The 2011-12 Budget primarily reflects a reduction of fixed term Commonwealth funding for the Social Housing and Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan initiatives. (h) The output costs of Empowering Individuals and Communities reflect the machinery of government transfer of functions of the Office of Women's Policy, the Office for Disability, the Office for Youth, and Community Programs for disadvantaged groups from the Department of Planning and Community Development to the Department of Human Services. (i) Total output cost for 2011-12 Budget may not equate to the total expense reported in Budget Paper No. 5, Chapter 3 Departmental financial statements due to additional statements in Budget Paper No. 5 that are not included in departmental output costs. Figures for 2010-11 Budget and 2010-11 Revised have been amended to reflect machinery of government changes and will not equate to total expenses reported in Departmental financial statements ."

Number of households assisted with long term social housing (public, Indigenous and community long-term tenancies at end of year) 77 260 76 322 76 200 73 644 number A household is defined as a tenancy agreement; it may include more than one person who is assisted into accommodation. Number of public housing dwellings with major upgrade during year number 1 800 1 955 1 900 3 712 Major upgrades are defined as upgrades with expenditure of over $10 000 per dwelling. The lower 2011-12 Target reflects the impact of a planned program of more substantial upgrades, which are expected to be delivered at a higher average cost based on current program estimates. Total number of social housing dwellings number 84 785 83 755 83 300 80 955 Social housing includes public rental housing, long term community housing and Indigenous housing. Total social housing dwellings acquired during the year number 1 600 3 700 3 800 3 221 Social housing includes public rental housing, long term community housing and Indigenous housing. The 2011-12 Target reflects the winding down of Commonwealth funding under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan . The 2010-11 Expected Outcome is lower than the 2010-11 Target due to the continued effects of inclement weather which has delayed the construction program. Major Outputs/Deliverables Performance Measures Unit of Measure 2011-12 Target 2010-11 Expected 2010-11 Outcome Target 2009-10 Actual Quality Proportion of public housing maintenance contractors completing urgent maintenance jobs that are within timeframes 95 95 95 95 per cent Urgent maintenance jobs are jobs that need to be completed within 24 hours, for example, an interruption of an essential service such as gas or power. Timeliness Average waiting time for public rental housing for those clients who have received early housing allocation 9.1 9.1 8 8.5 months The 2010-11 Expected Outcome and 2011-12 Target are higher than the 2010-11 Target as a result of better management strategies to reassess applications which has resulted in those who have been waiting longer, being housed. Therefore this results in a longer average waiting time. Cost Total output cost $ million 168.8 218.5 517.6 947.7 The 2010-11 Expected Outcome reduction primarily reflects Commonwealth funding for the Nation Building and Jobs Plan initiative that was budgeted for in 2010-11, however was received in advance in 2009-10. The 2011-12 Target primarily reflects a reduction in fixed term Commonwealth funding for the Social Housing and Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan initiatives."

(b) The 2010-11 output grouping name has been changed from 'Healthy and Productive Water Systems' to 'Sustainable Water Management and Supply'. (c) The variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget is largely due to the cessation of various projects under the Environmental Contribution Levy 2 program and program carryovers between 2009-10 and 2010-11. (d) The 2011-12 output grouping name 'Healthy and Productive Land; Healthy, Productive and Accessible Marine, Coastal and Estuarine Systems; and Flourishing Biodiversity in Healthy Ecosystems' has been separated into three output grouping names 'Healthy and Productive Land', 'A healthy and resilient natural environment', and 'Effective management of fire'. (e) The variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget is due to increased funding as a result of the late 2010 and early 2011 floods and the outcomes of the Parks Victoria Financial Sustainability initiative. (f) The variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget largely reflects increased revenue and expenditure associated with the Bushbroker Native Vegetation Offsets Program, and additional funding for the Integrated Planning and Building Hazard Mapping and Risk Response program.

(i) The variation between 2010-11 Budget and 2011-12 Budget is due to the implementation of election commitments, including Business sustainability accreditation program and Energy efficiency rebates for low income households, and an increase in the level of grant payments from the Sustainability Fund and HazWaste fund grants to help industry reductions in hazardous waste (or prescribed industrial waste) and to increase remediation of contaminated soils.

Measures can be discontinued because a program has ceased, milestones have been met or improved measures have been identified. Measures may change substantially due to a shift in focus for the service, development of improved measures or new data sets which can collect different information. Substantial changes to performance measures affect the ability to compare the measure over time. Each performance measure included here is accompanied by an explanatory footnote providing reasons for its discontinuation or change. To strengthen accountability and transparency associated with output performance management, the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee (PAEC) has been invited to review these performance measures to ensure that measures that are substantially changed or proposed to be discontinued receive a high level of scrutiny. After receiving the PAEC's recommendations on the measures in this appendix the Government will make any changes required. Amendments will be presented on the Government's budget website www.budget.vic.gov.au and changes will take effect from 2011-12. In the event that a measure listed in this Appendix is continued, a 2011-12 target has been identified to ensure continuity of reporting and transparency in the publication of performance information."

This partnership will be enhanced by opening up better communication channels between the two levels of government and establishing greater clarity regarding their respective roles. This in turn will facilitate the delivery of services to local communities in a more coordinated and consultative manner. A local government Ministerial-Mayors Advisory Panel is being established to consult with local governments and provide high level advice on the impact of state government decisions and legislation to ensure that unfunded responsibilities are not imposed on councils without consultation. In addition, an annual local government Ministerial forum involving all mayors and chief executive officers will provide a mechanism for consultation and sharing of ideas on key issues impacting on the local government sector. Research and projects to address the impact of councils' asset management requirements on their overall financial viability are underway. These efforts promote the successful integration of asset management into service planning and resource allocation. Access to financial and asset management capacity and expertise by councils and regional councils is an important component of this work. Local governments face significant challenges in managing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, drains and community buildings. A number of programs have been established to address this issue. They include the Regional Growth Fund which includes a $100 million Local Government Infrastructure program to support a range of council initiatives and community assets. Forty rural councils will also be able to apply for a share of $160 million of funding from the Country Roads and Bridges initiative over the next four years to ensure regional roads and bridges are renewed and maintained. The Government will reform legislation to support local government elections. Legislation will be presented to Parliament to bring forward the date of council elections from November to October to allow incoming councillors to meet the budgeting and corporate planning timetable. Legislation will also be introduced to give the voters of the Greater Geelong City Council the opportunity to directly elect their Mayor for a four year term. The Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission's (VCEC) report into streamlining local government regulation identified opportunities to strengthen economic, financial and resource management at the local government level. The Government is committed to supporting councils through a continuous improvement approach. The Government is also considering other reform opportunities identified by VCEC, including harmonisation of building site requirements and enhanced state-local government consultation. The Government will adopt an approach that cuts red tape, undertakes careful analysis and consultation and evaluates the impact of regulations to reduce burden on local government and business."

A new outcomes based metropolitan planning strategy will be developed with the input of local governments to provide greater certainty and focus development in appropriate locations and at an appropriate scale.

Councils fulfil vital responsibilities which include community services, local roads, waste management, recreation and cultural activities. In 2009-10 around 69 per cent of local government recurrent revenue was obtained from rates and charges levied by councils. Around 7 per cent of council recurrent revenue was provided by the Victorian Grants Commission as financial assistance grants which include general purpose grants and local roads grants. Other Commonwealth and Victorian grants comprised approximately a further 9 per cent of ongoing revenue. The remaining 15 per cent of ongoing revenue comes from Maternal Child Health (MCH) and Home and Community Care program (HACC) payments as well as revenues from interest on bank deposits and rental income from assets owned by local government. 1 According to the most recent Victorian Grants Commission data for the 2009-10 year. The Government also provides land and payroll tax exemptions to local government, which benefit Victorian councils by more than $260 million a year (refer to Tables 5.2 and 5.4 in Budget Paper No. 5).

(b) Excludes funds provided to local government from the Home and Community Care (HACC) program as this is for service delivery rather than provided as a grant. As shown in Table B.1, grants and transfers to local governments are expected to increase from $672 million in the 2010-11 Budget to $973 million in the 2011-12 Budget . This is primarily due to increased funding to local government under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and a suite of new initiatives such as the Department of Transport's Country Roads and Bridges initiative. The Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD) provides the majority of funds to assist local government. Around 73 per cent are Commonwealth financial assistance grants, including road and general purpose grants that are passed on to local government. Grants made to local government by DPCD varied from the original $574.6 million in the 2010-11 Budget to a revised $532.8 million. This variance is mainly due to the Commonwealth bringing forward payments for 2010-11 to June 2010 (2009-10 financial year). This is however, offset by the machinery of government transfer of Regional Development Victoria and the Regional Infrastructure Development Fund into DPCD. Grants and transfers are expected to increase to $654.5 million in the 2011-12 Budget due to the machinery of government change as well as a number of new initiatives in the 2011-12 Budget including funding from the Regional Growth Fund. The variance in payments by the Department of Business and Innovation (DBI) to local government is primarily the result of the machinery of government transfer of Regional Development Victoria to the DPCD and a number of programs for which funding ceases in 2010-11. Grants made to local government by the Department of Justice are expected to increase in the 2011-12 Budget from $1.1 million in the 2010-11 Budget to a revised estimate of $6.0 million mainly due to funding provided for the Neighbourhood Safer Places initiative that formed part of the bushfire response. Funding is expected to increase to $11.7 million in the 2011-12 Budget due to the continuation of the Neighbourhood Safer Places funding, Community Crime Prevention Program - Community Safety Fund and Public Safety, which will provide local councils with grants to implement major security infrastructure systems. Grants made to local government by the Department of Sustainability and Environment increased from $6.8 million in the 2010-11 Budget to a revised estimate of $12 million. This variation is mainly due to an increase in projects that work with local government such as Pricing for Sustainability, Small Towns Water Quality Fund, and Weeds and Pests on Public Land. Grants made to local government by the Department of Transport are expected to increase from $13.3 million in the 2010-11 Budget to $62.4 million in the 2011-12 Budget primarily due to the introduction of the Country roads and bridges initiative which provides funding to local councils. Grants made to local government by the Department of Treasury and Finance have increased from $13.5 million in the 2010-11 Budget to a revised estimate of $122 million due to additional funding being provided to local councils under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Funding is principally to reimburse for expenses incurred by local government to restore access and services to affected communities, and to repair pothole and road pavements on sections of the arterial road network damaged by flood waters and storms. Although this funding clearly represents an exceptional situation brought about by the floods, the increase in grant payments is expected to remain high into the 2011-12 Budget as flood repair work continues."

These funds are in addition to those specified in Table B.1 outlining Grants and Transfers to Local Government, noting that funding to local government can not always be estimated until grant programs are complete. During 2010-11, local governments received funding from a number of government programs which were funded from the CSF. This included the Victorian Community Support Grants program which is administered by the DPCD and which provided grants towards community infrastructure and community participation activities. Some examples of funded projects delivered by local government include: \u2022 funding of $150 000 to Pyrenees Shire Council as part of a $575 000 project to establish a Community Resource Centre in Avoca. This project will enable activities such as formal and informal adult education classes, self help groups, community meetings, social interaction, cultural and community activities. The broader project will also refurbish the library and information centre; \u2022 funding of $663 000 to Mornington Peninsula Shire Council as part of a $2.08 million project to construct a new Rosebud West Family and Children's Hub. The new community facility will deliver integrated and joined-up service delivery as well as a variety of meeting spaces and learning areas; \u2022 funding of $148 000 to the City of Casey as part of a $978 000 project for the Berwick Springs Park Pavilion and Community Room. The project will establish a community room which includes a new multi purpose space to be utilised by a range of groups in this growing community; and \u2022 funding of $250 000 to Corangamite Shire Council as part of a $426 000 project to support community planning in Corangamite Shire. The project will support community members to initiate township improvements to assist their economies, resilience, prosperity and capacity to drive change."
